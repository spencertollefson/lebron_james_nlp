53,"Cedi Osman is widely referred to as the GOAT of the NBA even though he is just a rookie, which begs the question, who is he?

Let's start here...where was he on Christmas day when the Cavs took on the Warriors?

This year, the Cavs and Warriors faced off on Christmas with the Warriors beating the Cavs 99-92.  Lebron had a quiet-ish night with 20 points shooting 7-18 from the field and couldn't quite get the Cavs the W they were hoping for.  This begs the question...*where was the GOAT on this night?* Could he actually be Santa Claus?

Well, Cedi was 'at the game' that night and 'played' in 6 total minutes, putting up a line of 0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0 while shooting 0-2 from the field.

As we all know, this is not the Cedi we are used to seeing.  As David Ortiz once said, [""This is our fucking Cedi""](https://youtu.be/lqD8iN03W6M?t=41s).  Ortiz obviously was referring to when Cedi had been signed from the Cavs and he knew he was going to be the next GOAT.

Well, let's go deeper.  Cedi would never drop such a poor statline, so was this *actually* Cedi playing in this game? Sure he shows up on ESPN's box score, but who says that wasn't a stunt double to replace our GOAT?

Was anyone specifically looking for Cedi on the court this day? He shot 0% from the field, which is 52.1% lower than his actual shooting percentage.  This is just not our Cedi and David Ortiz might be onto something here.

I for one, have never seen Cedi and Santa Claus in the same room, and I don't think anyone has.  And yeah, if you think the stunt double option may be off, well maybe that is why Cedi only played 6 minutes...he had much bigger things to worry about that day than playing basketball.

Overall, I think we need to open an investigation and get to the bottom of this.  Cedi, the Cavs, the fans, and David Ortiz all deserve to know where our Cedi was on this day.

77,"Takeaway's:

1. KD said LeBron and he are the two best players in the league - Everyone agrees about LeBron and most people agree about KD being 2nd. Steph is a great leader in my opinion to be able to have that alpha dog mentality and lead the warriors even though KD carries himself as the 2nd best player and Steph doesn't let that ego creep in - Kudos!

2. When asked about what they had to deal with as superstars in High school - Bron says the whole neighborhood looks up to them as the savior of the city while KD says everyone around is jealous and he was out there thinking about them and shutting them down with his play. Different thought processes.

3. About racial issues in America - Bron had his views like he always does and KD looked like he admired what Bron had to say.

4. Article about KD finding his voice after joining the Warriors - KD was very candid about himself and accepting the facts about himself. I liked how he says "" I don't have it all together yet but I am who I am, we all gonna mature at our own speeds"" Respect. 

5. LeBron talking about Social media instantly triggered laughs and KD said some good things but with his recent social media antics I had a laugh

6.  KD & Bron talking about how Bron grew into a role model kind of person and asking how he became a good husband and father was good. The mutual respect NBA players have for themselves is amazing.  

7. Bron asked KD about how he grew and again KD was real and candid about how he is still growing and how he wants to inspire people.

8. LeBron's obsession for his kids and the kids in his foundation is really something that is on display every time he speaks  about any issues. Props to him

282,"Not that I'm a big Simmons fan, but if you actually listen to what he says in context, instead of the paraphrasing above (that for some reason is in quotes), it's a lot less harsh.  Here are some actual quotes:

Paraphrase: *his 3 mos last year is as good as he's gonna be*

Quote: ""If you're looking at who do you want in a game seven, just from an unstoppable scorer standpoint... Durant, LeBron, Curry, Harden, Westbrook, Kawhi maybe, and Kyrie.  Those would be the eight.  I don't think anyone else has proven it on the biggest stages yet.  So [the Celtics] are looking at it like: [Kyrie] is just better than Isaiah.  He's younger than Isaiah.  He's somebody who has room to get better, whereas you could, I think we could agree, as much as I love Isaiah, the three months he played last year is as good as he's gonna be.""

Paraphrase: *""Against the Wiz, the IT thing is eye-opening, he can't guard Wall & Beal.""*

Quote: ""Isaiah, you know, in the Wizards series, again I love the guy, I'll defend him to the death, but the Wizards series, against Wall and Beal, was pretty eye-opening, they couldn't figure out who to play him on defense.  Kyrie's not a stud on defense, but the Isaiah thing was a real problem, and I think Washington should have beat Boston in that series.  I said it at the time.  They should have won Game 2, Beal missed a 12 footer, I thought Game 7, I thought Coach Brooks just coached a bad game.  I thought they had a better team, I thought Boston was lucky to win that series, and I think the Celtics themselves think they were lucky to win that series.""

Paraphrase: *""They made the Cavs worse.""*

Quote: ""They made the Cavaliers worse.  It's gotta be considered a good part of this trade.  The Cavaliers are worse than they were last year.  That Brooklyn pick?  Unless LeBron says 'I'm staying, flip that pick for a star', which I don't think he will, because he's going to keep his options open, that's been his M.O. for the whole time - that Brooklyn pick doesn't help them next year.  So they turned Kyrie into Isaiah, who we have no idea when he's starting the year, and Jae Crowder.""

Paraphrase: *""Jae, it's hilarious when people say he can guard bron (laughs), Jae couldn't guard him, KD, PG. He's a 7th man at best.""*

Quote: ""One of the things that's hilarious, when it's your own team, to hear people talking about it... players that you watch day in and day out, and then you hear people who obviously haven't... and people are like, 'Well who's gonna guard LeBron now that Jae Crowder's gone?'  It's like, Jae Crowder couldn't guard LeBron.  Jae Crowder got worse defensively last year.  He was a B-/C+ defensively; he was not that good.  I'm telling you, I watched the games.  He really slipped.  He's still a good help defender, not great, but his 1-on-1 stay in front of someone against the best small forwards in the league was not good.  And his three point shooting was as good as its been last year... all his shots were wide open, I don't think he shot even 40 percent.  I think he's a 7th man, I like Jae Crowder, but in terms of who's gonna stop LeBron and Durant and Paul George and all those guys next year, they need Jaylen Brown to step up.""",960,key_lime_pie,/r/nba/comments/6y06rs/bill_on_it_jae_they_made_the_cavs_worse_it_is_57/dmjr233/,dmjr233,1504562530.0,1504533730.0,"Bill on IT & Jae: ""They made the Cavs worse.

519,"Almost every year from 1995 on, ESPN bombarded us with a new high schooler that they thought was going to be the next big thing.  Sebastian Telfair had a documentary made about him, OJ Mayo was the next Jordan, Ryan Boatright committed to USC verbally when he was 13 and it made ESPN the magazine, Demetrius Walker was the supposed to be an icon when he got to the NBA before he hit puberty (he was 12).

Basically, the overtly-insane hype machine has been right twice:  Kobe, and LeBron.  They were both can't miss, but then again, they all were.  Another huge, athletic, skilled, muscular high school beating the absolute tar out of meager high school competition.  But once again, they all were, just like JP Tokeno, who had a blurb written about him in SI when he was 13.

But, LeBron was the internet age star.  He signed huge endorsement deals at 18.  He had a hummer at 16.  He seemed to be the most can't-miss out of all the can't-misses.  And they were right.

ESPN has been bombarding us with the fact they were right for close to a decade now.  Many have forgotten completely about Boatright, Walker, and Tokoto (hell, those are the only ones I really remember), and Telfair and Mayo have become precautionary tales.  Bill Willoughby is nothing more than a trivia question, the answer to ""who was the second high schooler to ever go directly to the NBA, 3 years after Moses Malone?""

545,"It goes even deeper. Kobe won the MVP in 2008 before Lebron won his first award. He then spent all of 08-09 [playing with a sore index finger] (http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1015940-a-gruesome-look-at-kobe-bryants-injury-history/page/8http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1015940-a-gruesome-look-at-kobe-bryants-injury-history/page/8). Sure he didn't miss any games, but I bet that his finger caused him to suffer mild discomfort at times.

568,"Physically dominant defensive center that will make it very difficult for easy points in the paint (e.g. Shaq, Dwight Howard, Joakim Noah, Marc Gasol, Tyson Chandler, etc.)

A good PF that can guard Bosh from getting the open shooter but can help clog the paint if Bosh isn't properly spaced (e.g. Pau Gasol, Zach Randolph, LaMarcus Aldridge, Taj Gibson, etc.)

Good perimeter defenders who can stick to their man and deny them the ball or deny them an easy shot (e.g. Tony Allen, Shane Battier, Thabo Sefolosha, Iman Shumpert, etc.)


Essentially, I see the Knicks if they're healthy and are playing well, the Lakers now that they seem to be playing a lot better than when they previously played Miami, the Grizzlies, the Chicago Bulls, but yeah.

570,"This kid doesn't and has never wanted to be a villain. He made a bone headed choice with his ESPN special and people will seemingly never forgive him for something so insignificant. He's a great guy, has never had any off the court issues and we demonize him worse than the Roelthesbergers and Buress' that are out there in sports. Been with his highschool sweetheart for a decade and has kids he loves no less. There are athletes who were actual total dicks like Michael Jordan out there (look up anything written about the guy from those close to him) but he's idolized because of his ability to WIN.

People will like LeBron James as soon as he wins and proves he can win in the Finals. It's stupid but It's the truth. That's the only way to redeem yourself in public light in sports. Be accused of rape like Kobe? Dave Chapelle said it best, all he did was play his ass off and we all forgot about that...
