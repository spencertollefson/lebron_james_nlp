21,"I don't understand why so many people are offended FOR heat fans.  You hear fans of all other teams make statements like ""this will alienate the fans.""  No. No it won't.  While Wade made me fall in love with basketball (and most likely the majority of Heat fans) he made me fall in love with the Heat. I am a Heat fan first and foremost.  I'll always love and respect Wade for what he done for the franchise but no one player is bigger than the team.  There doesn't have to be a winner and loser in this situation. Both teams got what they needed. Plus people take all the BS media spews out as gospel.  It's funny how much a ton of fans from other teams opinions varies from the majority of Heat fans yet they make statements like the speak for all of us.  I mean reports towards the end said that dollars weren't even the hold up for the deal.  It was the years. Wade wanted 3 we offered 2.  Yet people seem to think the issue is we offered him 10 million or whatever (funnily enough the EXACT report came up last season... Funny that.)  I feel the same way for Wade leaving as I did LeBron (obviously far stronger for Wade though) I love him and am so thankful for everything he done for the franchise and I hope he succeeds but at the end of the day I am a HEAT fan. Not a Wade fan.  My dream season would be bulls vs cavs in the 2nd round. Comes down to game 7 with LBJ and Wade both having like 100 points each. Wade hits the game winner. Then in the ECF Heat beat bulls in game 7 with Winslow hitting a game winner. We then proceed to sweep the warriors cause screw Dray.

TL;DR: Neither side needs to be a villain. Both parties did what was best for them. I love the heat and I love Wade.

And he got 4 finals appearances and two rings for that sacrifice. Wade took less at the height of his prime of his own accord- reports have said that he was upset that he didn't get credit for making the big three happen (credit he deserves).

As to what happened after LeBron left? Well, that's where Riley fucked up.

You could probably call offensive fouls on him more, but on the defensive side he basically never reaches or falls for pump fakes or gets called for blocks or anything like that. He's great at picking his spots for aggression and otherwise not doing anything dumb to get himself in foul trouble. When he gets beat or out of position, he kinda just lets it go and moves on to the next play.

the year after jordan left, the bulls added toni kukoc, steve kerr, luc longley, bill wennington, and pete myers. that's 4 players who would play significant roles in the 2nd 3peat. plus pippen had a career year. funnily, no one likes to point out that the bulls were a .500 team the following year before jordan came back. and then they won 72 games the first full season with jordan back.

RE: the cavs, when lebron left for the '10-'11 season, both shaq and z also left, and they lost mo williams, anderson varejao, jamario moon, and alonzo gee to injuries that 40+ games from each of them, plus antawn jamison missed 26 games to injury as well, not to mention that they changed coaches from mike brown to byron scott. if they don't lose everyone and also make the coaching change, we're probably talking about a .500 team.

This is my very first post on Reddit though we've been reading and enjoying your genius comments for years. So PLEASE help us!
Ever since the insulting clips getting out, tens of thousands of NBA and Cavs fans have flooded in that commentator's Weibo, asking him to apologize. So many fans including me have sent official complaints to Tencent Sports,NBA China and other media. YET WE GOT NO RESPONSES. 
What's worse, Fan Ke's partner Yi Yang during the commentary even asked the fans concerned about this incident to ""go worry about finding a job first before trying to sack someone else"" and denied remembering anything from that Game's Commentary.
The problem is Tencent is monopolizing all the NBA copyrights here. If they're trying to ignore this, that racist commentator will just safely keep his job. All the major media are ignoring the news even though it's trending on Weibo. We have to let the NBA or Cavs or LeBron team know about this because it's not just about him, it's about we have to put up with a worst kind of human being insulting our ears next year, interviewing the NBA stars while trying to pretend his worst curses and namecallings on them never existed. 
Please share this clip with anyone around you who knows Chinese and you'll know how serious this is. Tencent is the exclusive media providing the NBA content here as we don't have a choice! PLEASE let the.NBA know how horrible the situation is. We deserve some better commentators!
Thanks a lot. 谢谢你们。I will call out more Chinese fans to comment here. There's already more than 10,000 furious comments regarding this on our forum.",71,sevens777,/r/nba/comments/4sp432/chinese_commentator_using_insulting_words_at/d5b725u/,d5b725u,1468477198.0,1468448398.0,Chinese Commentator Using insulting words at LeBron James during live game provokes general rage among Chinese basketball fans,189,4sp432

I got this question about tipping. Let's say Lebron or some other wealth person goes to an expensive club or restaurant and orders like a $50000 rare and expensive bottle of wine or champagne. Now, a $50000 bottle of wine isn't more of a hassle than a $100 wine to a waiter. Should the waiter be tipped 20% of the cost of the bottle which will come out to be $10,000, or is $100 good enough of a tip? Personally, I'm on the side of tipping $100.

Even before LeBron officially won in Cleveland, much of America was behind Cleveland during the series, because people like underdogs. 

&nbsp;

I know personally that I always root for underdogs or the team that has less championships/recent success in any series other than one concerning my own team. If a team has NO championships, that makes me root even harder. NO championships+drought?! I might as well been a closet Cavs fan this postseason once Miami got knocked out.

The Heat have repeatedly (and honestly, smartly) chose others ahead of Wade and used his ability to be a company man against himself. They've leveraged his age and health factors against him. You got to sacrifice 10 to keep LBJ there because he'd be Wade's workhorse who kept the Heat at the top, which is good for Wade. If /when LeBron bolts, it's their duty to make him whole or give less w promises of other moves. 

So of course they offer less and make some good moves, but this is the 3rd summer in a row the Heat have said ""we are going after this and this first then helping you out after"".

A **73 Win Team**... 


Also Kyrie likes murder his shot at the end sealed the fate of what to me is the single most important finals series there's ever been as far as all-time legacy narratives between a team vying to be considered the best ever and a player who wants to be considered the greatest ever. The only pain about it was the blowout ball era and lack of quote on quote close games in the series but even plus 10 point differential is not as much when teams can add on threes like these ones can. 


The most fucked up part about all of this is we might not get a series of this level next year most likely or maybe ever again in our lifetimes even, with these kind of implications.

784,"All comparisons to MJ aside, LeBron is such a good person.  MJ was exciting, competitive,  blah blah blah we've all heard it.  But LeBron seems way more relatable.  He's a great player,  and in my opinion just as great of a person.  On the court it looks like he hates the guys he competes with the most,  draymond,  Noah, pg, etc. But he knows it's just a game and is always respectful after the fact.  Except maybe not to Noah lol.  But him and green sharing words after game 7, him helping up steph in the biggest game ever  after the series was getting very tense, high fixing Paul George.  Idk to me it just doesn't seem right to hate this guy. 

I've grown up with LeBron, and I've
 grown up watching other greats. But I've seen no one at his level of both skill and prestige have as much class as him.  If he truly hates someone,  wed never know it.  We can only assume from the limited access to his life we have.  In all likelihood he hates draymond green but as a role model to young kids and the face of the league, he always shows face and takes the high road. 

James is the Goat in my mind only because of what I think he means to young nba fans.  He was eighteen when he started playing,  grew up without a father,  was built up to be a good and torn down when he made a mistake.  He never made a mistake like the decision  again and when u compare to what other stars get away with its peanuts.  This dude is one of the best role models I've ever seen,  and he's under the microscope of every nba writer on the planet. You couldn't ask for a better role model,  except maybe a guy like KD or cp3.  Stand up guys. You might miss the gritty 90s, but I appreciate how well guys have been conducting themselves lately  and LeBron is the pinnacle  of this.

842,"I get that it's boring to give the MVP to the same guy year after year, but LeBron is - without a doubt - the best **and** most valuable player to any team. 

Look at the Cavs before, during, after, then during LeBron again. Lottery team to perennial playoff contender back to lottery team and back again. All because one guy wasn't there anymore. 

You could put LeBron on the absolute *worst* team in the league every year and he would get them to the playoffs. That's what he does, that's who he is. The Most Valuable Player to any team in the NBA. 

When Mozgov forgot how to play basketball this year, LeBron carried the weight. When Love forgot to show up for the Finals, LeBron carried him too. The man is an absolute freak of nature, a basketball savant, and a one-of-a-kind talent that we'll probably never see again, like Jordan or Magic or Wilt. 

I'm not ready to declare him GOAT (despite my obvious bias) because Jordan was a goddamn *machine* out there. You wouldn't see Jordan wearing a frog-tea hat or talking shit about the ""haters"" on social media, Jordan would shut them up on the court then blow $50k in five minutes on the blackjack table while banging your girlfriend in front of you. *That's* who Jordan was - an animal, an absolutely ice-cold killing machine - and LeBron isn't that same guy. LeBron is nice, he wants to be friends with his competitors off-court, and that's fine too. 

Kobe was Jordan Lite. LeBron isn't anything Lite, he's LeBron Raymone James, and he is now and always will be the best player to ever don the Cleveland Cavalier uniform. 

And for that, and this title, he's *my* unanimous MVP.

The other thing you need is a Lebron stopper.  You'll never stop him, but if you've got a guy who can kind of bother him and you limit transition plays, you give yourself a chance to win.
