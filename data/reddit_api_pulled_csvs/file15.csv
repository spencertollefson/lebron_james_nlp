104,"And here we see the perfect example of where stats don't tell the whole story. I can understand the post just based on these individual stats alone but you would have to watch the two play to understand the impact of each player, and when you do you see lebron is far better at that age. Not to mention that but lebron came in first season for the cavs and took over the whole team from that point forward. 

Lebron led his team to 50 wins and the second seed in the east, admittedly a weak conference but the way he lead that team in the playoffs was his best achievement at the age of 22 and we conveniently leave that out because Giannis played less than half the playoff games. The fact that you have to ignore the playoffs entirely because of the difference in sample size should completely negate any kind of conclusion you draw from this comparison.

Then you compare skillset vs skillset, Lebron has him beat in every area that matters. Lebrons a far better scorer, faaar better passer, dribbler and distributor and thats not a knock on giannis but this is lebron we are comparing. Giannis is taller, as you mention second tallest on his team so its no surprise he grabs a bunch of rebounds. 

In terms of 22 year old comparisons i don't even think lebron is the best 22 year old there ever was so its an odd comparison, as other people have said kobe has a huge argument and theres a few others aswell.

105,"I think Giannis is going to be (and probably already is) a tremendous player. That being said, I also think the way the game is played today make putting up crazy stat lines a little easier. The amount of 3's being shot means you can compile an impressive number of assists just by swinging the ball around, as opposed to really creating a good look for a teammate. This creates long rebounds that used to be dominated by the bigs. Less bigs on the court in general also makes rebounding easier. I just think comparing stats of players even 10 years ago is tricky without context.

318,"When your physical body is injured or becomes ill it takes time to recover, for example once you have broken a leg it is inevitable that you are going to have to spend time allowing it to recover and heal.

On a psychological level our subtle body or thought body is more flexible, malleable or ‘plastic’. When you take an emotional ‘hit’ to your psychic body the time it takes to recover is not fixed. **We see this for example when two people facing the same circumstances, for example being sacked from their job** or being rejected by someone they are attracted to, take different times to recover from such a blow. One person may go into a deep depression; the other may bounce back very quickly. **The latter person almost seems like Tom in the Tom and Jerry cartoons when he is squashed flat by an enormous hammer (or equivalent) and then after a few moments bounces right back into his original shape, and resumes chasing the mouse!**

The reason why the psychological recovery time of some people is so fast is because, actually if we know how to, we can heal our psychological body very quickly; it is made of energy, not flesh and bone, so it can change shape rapidly, sometimes instantaneously.


If we understand this, then we should at the very least be interested in how we can mindfully accelerate our own psychological healing and ability to become a bit more ‘Tom and Jerry –like’ in our approach to psychological healing.",75,Sim888,/r/nba/comments/6ie3cc/lebron_on_instagram_headed_to_workouts_watching/dj5gkic/,dj5gkic,1497995167.0,1497966367.0,LeBron On Instagram: Headed to workouts watching my favorite cartoon of all-time!

391,"Since we are getting ""He gone"" comments I actually want to have a serious discussion on that matter. Anyone else that wants to feel free to comment on this comment train.

I'll start with I think this is the beginning of LeBron's departure again. I don't foresee the Cavs beating the Warriors next season even if they were able to get Butler or PG13. At the very worst the Warriors would still be sizable favorites. LeBron has also already won the championship for Cleveland that he promised and has expressed desire to play ""somewhere warm"" with the Banana Boat crew. While it's tough to envision LeBron going West this does open a few options for him notably the Lakers, Spurs, or Clippers. If he stays East it is a narrow pool. It's basically restricted to Miami and I'm not sure if his relationship with Pat Riley is mended or salvageable at this point.

Basically it comes down to 3 choices IMO:

1. LeBron still wants to go for that GOAT title and will do whatever he can to win more championships. This could mean staying in Cleveland or pursuing other attractable offers.

2. LeBron is satisfied with his legacy and wants to stay in Cleveland AND make as much money as possible, likely making the Finals for another 3+ years but not improving the roster because of his eventual ballooned cap hit.

3. LeBron is satisfied with his legacy and wants to have fun elsewhere with the Banana Boat team.

I personally think he's still addicted to surpassing MJ.",297,MelGibsonDerp,/r/nba/comments/6iauvq/beck_source_lebron_is_disappointed_at_griffins/dj4t2fn/,dj4t2fn,1497950935.0,1497922135.0,"[Beck] Source: LeBron is ""disappointed"" at Griffin's departure, as well as the timing, & ""concerned"" abt what this portends for Cavs going forward.",1758,6iauvq

534,"I played against Lebron a handful of times when he was a Freshman, so I have a little experience in this area.  

I'll relay my thoughts about the game I remember the most.

I was 18.  A senior, decent athlete, a few D3 offers, a few ""preferred walk on"" for some D1 schools.  I was 6'3-6'4 and 180-190 pounds.  He was 13-14 years old, and and near the same size as I was.. but enormous feet, long arms, but lanky.  Probably weighed... 170?

I'll try to keep it somewhat short... I could hold my own against him, only because he was very, very raw.  I feel my game was as polished as it could be, while he was still just getting things figured out.  We both ended the game with similar stat lines, but the X factor was just the raw explosiveness and athleticism... something you honestly can't account for when talking about size, weight and even age.  

I'm sure alot of you have played basketball, maybe even lately.. but you know that first few possessions of the game?  Sizing things up.. who can move, who can shoot, how are they guarding us....   Lebron was already on a different planet in terms of just sheer velocity.  He could just get off of his feet, make a cut, or grab a rebound while I'm still flat footed.  He didn't have springs in his legs.. he had trampolines.  I had played against alot of tier 1 talent at that point at 5-Star and Blue Chip camps, but the odd thing is.. I knew IMMEDIATELY that this guy was something different.. and that isn't just hindsight. 

Anyway, we lost that game by 6.  Which ended up being their closest game of the year (applause? kappa)... Lebron got a steal in the last 5 seconds to close the game.. and traveled the length of the court for the final ""nail in the coffin"" dunk.   I was so pissed of.. he wasn't going to dunk on our home floor... I'm going to chase this FRESHMAN down and foul the hell out of him.   Now.. I could jump, could dunk fairly easily.. so I figured... I can do this.. plus we are the same size.. what could go wrong?  So I get to him (he sort of took a wide approach angle), jump... andddd he's clearly a foot above me at the apex.  Easily a foot.  I felt like Isiah in that Celtics series this year.   I quickly decided to just do what I could, and just wailed on whatever part of his arms or head I could reach.  The dunk failed, so I guess it was a success... but it was just another lesson I realized that game.  This man is far superior, and he hasn't even hit puberty yet.  This is also one of those days when I decided to not play basketball in college.  A rude awakening to just how good you have to be compete.

Anyway.. back to your question... St. V was good that year with alot of studs, so Lebron was considered ""the next big thing"", but everyone knew he was different.  I first heard about him when he was around 11 years old, and I know he was beating people up at the courts since at least that age.  It's also important to realize that Lebron had absolutely NO ""puberty"" stage of being uncoordinated, or 'weak', or anything of the sort.  Maverick (Lebron's cousin / business manager) used to say that ""he's the one to watch out for"".. back when we were maybe 15-16 (Maverick was trying to steal my girlfriend, who went to St.V..... Mav if you are somehow reading this... what's good man?)... 

..so that being said.. all I can say is.. athleticism and that 'god given' freak-of-nature, all-worldy talent is just something you have to 'witness' to fully comprehend.

I'd certainly prefer he finishes his career in Cleveland but also know at the end of the day he's going to do what he wants. It's also a possibility I think a lot of fans are more prepared for this time around -- people are well aware he and his crew have been situating out on LA and know that's where his post-NBA career lies, and people also know the reality of what the Cavs face in trying to get another title. It would have a profound effect on the franchise and city, as it did the first time around, but I'd probably try to look at the bright side and come up with reasons why it can turn into a positive (although really the only one I can think of at the moment is it would mean the Cavs wouldn't be tied into the long-term high-money/potentially high-risk contract for an aging LeBron that I think he will inevitably ask for).

And because they didn't actually get paid $300 million over the course of Kobe's career, these fans are a *lot* more bitter when someone surpasses Kobe's reputation and legacy. Kobe himself doesn't give a shit about these player comparisons. Almost all successful NBA athletes don't honestly give a shit.

652,"Quickly... My stance on KD/GSW hasn't changed from the moment it happened in July 2016 dating back to the week it happened and the podcasts I did (listen to ep 109 with House again). And that was before I ever interviewed KD on HBO much less the 3 pods we did. You can disagree with my belief that LeBron 2010 and KD 2016 were different situations - and you might even be right, maybe I am off on this one. But you can't say that I changed my stance to help my access with KD. It's ludicrous. My stance is the same it was 12 months ago. I'd love to do pods with Kyrie, Love, LeBron, whomever. (I think I've had 50+ NBA players on my pod at this point.) Anyway - peace out and thanks for listening. Just had to weigh in on this one.

653,"I always listen to Simmons and will continue to do so, but he's completely lost the ability to be objective about anything with KD. I'm fine with being ok with what Durant did, but to pretend that The Decision was worse in terms of what it says about LeBron as a person is insane. The delivery was obviously much worse, but I can't imagine how one could look at the situation objectively and say that what KD did was good and what LeBron did was bad. Ultimately I think they're basically the same, both players were completely within their rights to make the choices they did, both were not the most competitive moves, both reflected the quality of their old teams and the stupid ringzzz culture we've created. Either you're in favor of player agency and creating super teams or you're not.


*Edit* I'm really glad he did this episode with Chris Ryan, who is always thoughtful and unafraid to be straight up with Bill. Simmons's greatest talent is recognizing other talented people, and Chris Ryan definitely fits that mold. If you look at the Ringer NBA show, he figured out pretty quickly that Tjarks wasn't a leading man and found KOC to fill that role.",60,mynameisntshawn,/r/nba/comments/6hit75/ringer_nba_show_bill_simmons_on_lebron_james/diynegg/,diynegg,1497598614.0,1497569814.0,"[Ringer NBA Show] Bill Simmons on LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Offseason Moves, and NBA Draft Advice",79,6hit75
654,"So this is the quote in the reddit thread I think he refers to early on:

>""So when my wife asked in all sincerity, ""What's the big deal if they play together?"" I couldn't really explain it to her other than to say, ""It's a basketball thing. You just don't do it."" Your goal as an alpha dog is to assemble the best team you can and beat the other alpha dogs. There are five alpha dogs right now: LeBron, Wade, Kobe, Howard and Durant. If two ended up on the same team by coincidence -- like Kareem and Magic, Shaq and Kobe, or Michael and Scottie -- that's one thing. That's sports. S--- happens. But willingly deciding that it would be easier to play together than beat one another? Even two weeks later, I can't get over it. LeBron's last two Boston games were a massive disappointment to anyone who truly cares about basketball, but for me, copping out by joining forces with Wade was even worse.""

I honestly don't feel like he's addressed it properly, he's talked around it. He says the last two games were ""a massive disappointment"" from LeBron. I think most people would agree that KD's last few games against the Warriors were hardly his best. They blew a 3-1 lead and KD played below his standard in the last 2 or 3 games, with Woj reporting this going on during this series- making it weirder (if Woj is a reliable source):

>>“I know Russell (Westbrook) was bothered by — and some other teammates were too — of, like, there was some knowledge there that Draymond (Green) was in contact with Kevin (Durant) all season long and they’re in a playoff series and I know there was some conversation around the Thunder team of ‘Hey man, this guy kicked Steven Adams in the nuts twice in this series and what are you doing hanging out with this guy? What’s the relationship? We’re trying to beat these guys.’”

Source- [http://sports.yahoo.com/news/the-vertical-pod-with-woj--jeff-van-gundy-kevin-durant-free-agency-144155644.html](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/the-vertical-pod-with-woj--jeff-van-gundy-kevin-durant-free-agency-144155644.html)

He talks about how ""alpha dogs"" shouldn't team up. By anyone's standards Steph Curry would be an alpha dog. So would KD, he even says he already is in 2010. He talks about ""copping out"", but isn't joining the team that beat you and already have a championship more of a cop out?

He also talks about the quality of team OKC put around Durant, but again, everyone would agree the Cavs teams around LeBron were worse. LeBron trusted them to build a good enough team, they clearly failed way more than OKC did. How is Durant wanting a new style of basketball fine (it is) but surely LeBron also wanted that? Look who he played with before.

In my opinion, the only argument is the TV special thing, which LeBron has admitted was wrong and KD has the advantage of seeing how badly that went. You could also cite the way he didn't let Westbrook and the team know as not handling it perfectly.

He's also asked if LeBron going again would get to him. He then goes on to say he's not sure if he'd be ok with it as a Cavs fan. How is it not fine, having won a ring there as promised, but KD is fine, having never won one? He didn't leave OKC in a young winning situation, just like he accuses LeBron of doing? The trade for Oladipo was sold as a fit with KD and Westbrook, not just Westbrook. If anything just with Westbrook its a bad move, due to the spacing.

Note, this is not me hating on Durant, I think its fair enough that he moved (if slightly disappointing, the same as LeBron's was) but is me being unhappy with /u/sptguy33 response and clear bias between the two.
