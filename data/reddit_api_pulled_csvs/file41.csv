33,"I'll download it right now...

So the opening screen is [this](http://i.imgur.com/se6VLxn.png) 

This app has four sections. Athlete, NBA Playoffs, Style, and Journey.

So I started first in the Athlete section. I choose where it said block of the night, and it took me [here](http://i.imgur.com/LNTqGjx.jpg). It's a video of LeBron's block on Joe Johnson. 



I went down one, and hit Postgame: LeBron James. And of course, it gave me a link to the post game conference video. 

In this section there was also a selection for the game highlights. 

After the videos, the pictures are next on the list

His post game stretch... [here](http://i.imgur.com/por9xcg.jpg)

[His post game interview](http://i.imgur.com/QbYLyfc.jpg) (it's a photo, not video). Then after a couple pictures, it was more highlights, but these were of him.

Then below that (remember we are still in the first section), is like Twitter updates. [Like this](http://i.imgur.com/o41qBqw.jpg). That is basically the whole first section. Just pictures, videos, and updates related the Athlete LeBron James. 

---
---

The Next Section is labeled NBA Playoffs 

[This is the only picture that is needed](http://i.imgur.com/RBbrygX.png). It's just statistical information. 

---
---

The next section is labeled Style, and it is exactly what you would think it is. It's pictures about LeBron's style. This is where you can also find the Lebron Radio. Which is where you can listen to songs that he does, I guess. 

http://i.imgur.com/ZoBCrxx.png

---
---

The final section is labeled Journey. This is a place that is basically for his instagram photos. Documenting his Journey through the NBA. I decided not to take a screen shot because it's no use. Just go look at his instagram. 

---
---

[From '84-'98 Jordan's FG% is above 50%.](http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jordami01.html)  The dip in Jordan's second year is also due to an extremely small sample size of 18 total games, 7 as a starter, while only averaging 25 minutes per game.

237,"It's a close call.  Both teams were 5th in the league in Opponents PPG allowed and both were average or below average offensive teams that relied on their respective stars to carry a heavy load.  

The second fiddle (offensively) for [Iverson's Sixers](http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/PHI/2001.html) was Aaron McKie, for [Lebron's Cavs](http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CLE/2007.html) it was Larry Hughes.  Both team's had great defensive schemes and good defensive coaches.  Both leaders were young during their Finals trips. (25 year old Iverson and 22 year old James)

I feel like AI's teams played the tougher opponents en route to the Finals, first facing Reggie, Jalen and Jermaine's Indiana team then Vince and Antonio's Toronto team before meeting Milwaukee in the ECF.  That 2001 ECF is a widely forgotten, and much underrated, series.  Ray Allen, Glenn Robinson and Sam Cassell vs ""Iverson and the Defenders.""  

[During the 2001 ECF,](http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_2001_ECF.html#PHI-MIL) Iverson logged 46 minutes per game while averaging **30.5PPG  4.8RPG  6.8APG  2.2SPG  34.4 FG%** and the series still went 7 games.  

Lebron also logged 46 minutes per game against Detroit [in the 2007 ECF](http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_2007_ECF.html#CLE-DET) and averaged **25.7PPG  9.2RPG  8.5APG  2.7SPG  44.9 FG%** with Cleveland winning in 6.

Iverson had two teammates scoring in double digits (McKie and Mutombo) while Lebron had two (Gibson and Ilgauskas).  Only two more players (Jermaine Jones & Tyrone Hill) even scored above 8 points per game on AI's team but they relied heavily on the Answer to create shots.  Lebron's team had two more players (Pavlovic & Gooden) average more than 9 points per game and two additional players (Varejao & Hughes) average more than 7ppg.  

In the Finals Iverson played one of the best playoff teams of all time, the Shaq/Kobe lakers.  Here's LA's ascension to the title that year:

[(3-0)](http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_2001_WC1.html#LAL-POR) against a very formidable Blazers squad.

[(4-0)](http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_2001_WCS.html#LAL-SAC) against one of the best teams of that era, Webber, Vlade & Peja's Kings.

[(4-0)](http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_2001_WCF.html#LAL-SAS) against Duncan's Spurs.

The Lakers mercilessly ripped through the playoffs and treated opponents like chew toys until Iverson and the Sixers stole Game 1 of the Finals from them on their home court.  Counting the playoffs, LA had a 38-11 home record that season, with three of their losses coming in OT *(Shaq missed 8 regular season games, Kobe missed 14)* and only one loss coming in the playoffs at the hands of Iverson.  If AI and that Philly team didn't run into the greatest playoff team in history then I think they win the title.  

With Lebron I don't know if that's the case.  San Antonio was a fantastic team in 2007 but they weren't *2001 Lakers* dominant.  James has the better individual statistics, but Iverson was an X-factor for an extremely competitive and extremely memorable team in such a unique way.  I think there's only a handful of players in history who could've done what AI did in that same situation.  Lebron also gets props for shouldering such a heavy load at age 22 but I give the slight edge to Allen Iverson.  He may have had slightly better teammates (certainly not offensively) but he had the tougher road so his playoff resume, to me, is more impressive.  To wrap up,

[Lebron's Finals:](http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_2007_finals.html#SAS-CLE)  **22PPG  7RPG  6.8APG  1SPG  .5BPG  35.6 FG%  42.6MPG  0 Wins**

283,"A day or so ago I posted a comment saying I had calculated some of LeBron's career totals and that he would rank very highly in nearly every stat. Several people requested the stats so I put them into a very rudimentary google spreadsheet. 

Note : these statistics are not meant or guaranteed to be accurate in any way. I couldn't think of a very good formula for standard decline in a player. If I had taken some time to analyze some other top players over the ends of their careers I could have developed a much better method, but the very simple one that I chose is that each year, LeBron will only play 95% as well as the year prior to that in every category. I thought at first this would show a more gradual decline vs. a straight 5% drop every year, which it did, but it also shows a smaller drop every year than the year previous which I would bet rarely ever happens as players get older.

Regardless, though, as I said this was just for fun and in no way meant to be scientific. I'm sure you guys will have better ideas on how to calculate player decline and I'd be happy to make another graph, but this just goes to show what a monster career LeBron will have regardless what year he chooses to retire.

Also note that I don't assume LeBron will play until he's 38, but it's not unprecedented. Tim Duncan is still going strong. Anyway, all feedback is welcome and I hope you guys enjoy.

Nobody can blame Barkley for getting drafted into a stacked conference, wasting multiple seasons on a shit show squad in Philly then getting traded to the, by that time, stronger conference.

Winning a championship in any sport involves a lot of luck.  Not just luck in winning games, luck in things aligning for you as a player.  You've got to be drafted to a team that develops your talent, gives you opportunity to grow.  Then you've got to have complimentary pieces, guys who aren't just good enough to play their role but also play a role that benefits what you bring to the table.  (Ie. Shooters around Lebron, ball handlers around Shaq)  You also have to be lucky enough to get the right playoff matchup.

487,"The NBA rule for Flagrant foul 1 is found in NBA *Comments on the Rules*, Section II, paragraph B: ""A flagrant foul—penalty (1) is unnecessary contact committed by a player against an opponent.""

You will notice that the rule is not based on *amount of contact* or whether the player was making a ""basketball play"". All the referee has to do is decide that the contact was unnecessary, **with no regard to intent**.

While not as official as the rules, referees have a formula that can *assist* in determining common foul versus Flagrant 1 versus Flagrant 2. The formula is the acronym WIF: Windup, Impact, and Follow-thru. If one or two of these elements is present, it is usually a flagrant 1 foul. If two or three elements are present, it is usually a flagrant 2 foul. In the play where LeBron elbowed Hibbert, the *Impact* element was present. Combined with the rule language, the referees decided that this *Impact* was *unnecessary*.

Now don't get me started on the Scola-LeBron play: I thought both *Windup* and *Impact* were present and though it was an easy Flagrant 1 (no ejection).",44,OfficiatingAnalysis,/r/nba/comments/21h5qb/lebron_on_hibbert_his_face_happened_to_hit_my/cgd49zg/,cgd49zg,1395937167.0,1395908367.0,"LeBron on Hibbert: ""His face happened to hit my elbow.""

Did Jordan get the same hate LeBron did by NBA fans? Hell. No. Hell no. 

Jordan was beloved by most in his playing days because he came off as an extremely likeable person. [The smile](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Rx5kuQSk-rg/TBKZCreKtYI/AAAAAAAAAfg/73oNUgmcPSY/s0/jordon+SMILING.jpg), the [endorsements](https://www.fitzness.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Michael-Jordan-Wheaties-Box.jpeg), and his innate ability to project a good image and protect it all contributed to this. 

Exceptions: Utah fans, Knicks fans, Cleveland fans, etc.

Jordan had an underdog story. People saw him fail over and over again before climbing the top of the mountain. They saw him put in the work and that he earned everything he got. 

And above all? He was a winner. Everybody loves a dude who goes on the NBA Finals when everybody is watching and then rips their heart out on the basketball court, whether it be 55 points on the Suns, a 3-point barrage in the 1992 Finals, or the classic Flu Game. And he did all this with a smile. Something tells me he picked up some of his charm from Magic, but most of it comes naturally to him probably because IIRC in high school people loved him because he was a jokester who just wanted to have a good time.

Nobody protected their image like Jordan. He was the ultimate PR man. The man would take a shower extremely quickly in the locker room and put on a fresh suit before the media would be allowed in for interviews. He felt every eye that was staring at him and wanted to present the best image possible in case that's their only ""Michael Jordan"" moment in their lives. MJ would also ask the media sometimes to protect him or not put out a story and that he'll give them quotes in return or something like that. 

The point I'm trying to make is that while Nike/NBA/Chicago Tribune/whatever did help maintain his image, _it all starts with Jordan's exceptional tact to present his likability._",62,VintageVino,/r/nba/comments/21h1ro/did_jordan_get_the_hate_lebron_gets/cgcyp0w/,cgcyp0w,1395917584.0,1395888784.0,Did Jordan get the hate Lebron gets?,28,21h1ro

751,"My opinion on this is a little bit different. It is impossible to be more dominant than MJ in his prime. He won every full year, had the individual accolades, and was essentially unbeatable. You can be as good as that, but not better. If lebron wins say, the next 3 rings, then I don't really care about 6 rings vs 5 or MVPs or anything. It would be safe to say that Bron was untouchable in his prime too. They were both on a short list of people that single handedly dominated the league during their prime. It includes Russell, Jordan and hypothetically LBJ. 


As such, for LBJ to be better than MJ, you would have to make the argument that the competition was better. Let's be honest, that is the main reason why Russell is not talked about as much as you would think in GOAT conversations, and rightfully so. The NBA was kind of a joke back then compared to in the 90's after bird and magic brought it back. BBall wasn't nearly as popular outside of urban centres and a few states, and racism prevented a lot of greAt players from even being in the league.


I think you can make a similar argument for LeBron against MJ. Basketball is a global sport now. There is a much bigger player pool and fewer barriers to entry (ironically this is in large part due to MJ). Take all sentimentality about your favorite players out of it, and that equals one thing - the NBA is harder to dominate in 2014 than it was in the 90's. People will respond to this due to nostalgia about how the league was tougher and more skilled and such, at the end of the day it comes down to math. there are more people fighting for each job, so even after controlling for natural improvements in conditioning, skill, strategy, etc. the league is more competitive. 


So, is LeBron better than MJ? no. he has yet to prove unstoppable for an sustained period of time. But if he does? My answer will be yes. 


*** the one major hole in my argument is that i havent talked about strength of teammates. well, its obvious based on jordan's career pre-pipp and lebron's pre-heat that everyone needs good teammates. Were russels the best? arguably, but he did it for 11 years, so with all the roster movement etc. you gotta give a lot of the credit to him. Let's just say they all had elite teammates at most times, but things go up and down and if you are the constant, you're probably doing something right.",71,,/r/nba/comments/1zimi5/personally_what_would_you_need_to_see_from_lebron/cfu60v4/,cfu60v4,1393980068.0,1393951268.0,"Personally, what would you need to see from LeBron before you could call him better than Jordan?",89,1zimi5
752,"If he wins a 'chip this year, retires to explore a career in football, plays TE or WR for the Dolphins for one season, finishes top 5 in his position, comes back to the Heat, and wins a couple more championships, then I'd say he's the GOAT. 


Kidding aside. I think it's still ridiculous to compare LeBron and Jordan using the same ruler. Winning another championship won't make him GOAT.

753,"Rings are a really old-fashioned (and uneducated, IMO) factor to consider when ranking players. Winning a championship requires very complex team chemistry. Rings are team achievements, and individual players should not be credited for being the reason for the wins. It's sad to believe people will believe MJ is less talented of a basketball player if he didn't get Pippen or Rodman on his team, and the Bulls didn't win 6 championships, if he put up equally good numbers (or better), and displayed equivalent skills. Once again, player achievements have an impact on teams winning, but just because you're really good doesn't mean you can take the Utah Jazz to 6 rings, whether you're MJ or Lebron. And I don't believe if someone is stuck with the Jazz for their whole career,  puts up 33/8/7 for their career, on 55% fg, stellar defense, but they win just 1 ring, that they shouldn't be considered the GOAT. Players skill =/= team winnings.

After Friday’s game, James was asked about his reaction when he sees other players shooting 30 — or as much as 37 — attempts in a game.
“I had [almost] 40 now with 18 shots, I mean … If you give me 37 shots in a game, I’d put up 60. Easy,” James said.

We don't know what can happen from now to July, so what I've been able to do this whole season to this point is just worry about what's at hand and that's winning another championship. And hopefully at the end of this year I can put myself in a position where I can hold that Larry O'Brien Trophy up once again and then I will assess what I have to do with my future after that.""
