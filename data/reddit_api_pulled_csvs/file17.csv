- Heat big 3 were Super Saiyan 1 on their way to Super Saiyan 2
- LeBron ascended to Super Saiyan 2 on his own and went to the Cavs to share his newfound powers
- Warriors big 3 were the new, younger, more stylish group and easily found their way to Super Saiyan 2
- They each get 1 victory, but the younger Warriors were able to ascend to Super Saiyan 3

* Not diplomatic, thin skin and huge immaturity issues that never went away.

* As he aged his talent level couldn't keep up with the hyper work ethic required to be elite (Being late, being overweight, not dedicating enough off court work to expand basketball knowledge, basically a supremely talented Big Baby Davis)

* Couldn't keep internal matters contained, before the internet and TMZ were big Shaq notoriously had a way to plaster and leak **every** dispute and friction all over the media.


Watch one segment of NBAonTNT and you can see how a personality like Shaq would clash with most people much less Kobe in his early 20s. 

Kyrie and Lebron might've hard time adjusting and learning about each other when they first met, I just never saw LeBron not be able to compromise or at least lead by example.

355,"In a broader sense, it's true. As I've followed the NBA closely since the assembling of Ubuntu Celtics (2007-2013, R.I.P.), LeBron's most formidable opponents were 2005-2007 Pistons, Magic with Prime Howard, Celtics (even when old and grumpy, although the loss of Ray-Ray was a hard hit), Defensive Juggernaut-Pacers. Everyone else, including Rose's Bulls and 60-win-""Player of the Month""-Hawks in my opinion, have been lesser foes to beat. These last two years have been the most lackluster showings in the East since 2000-2002, besides some relative feel-good stories in the regular season. Cavs are just head and shoulders above others in the Eastern Conference playoff's, it is even sadder than the current West. Might continue to be, unless Bucks-76ers-Wizards rapidly evolve. The others are kinda stuck, although the solution might be as ""easy"" as Myler Turner turning into a 23-11-3-1-2 superstar.

LeBron's opponents however, have been getting tougher in the Finals, indeed. 2011-2012 Mavs and OKC were sorta like Zod for Superman. 2013-2014 Spurs were Doomsday, the latter one being the one to ""kill"" his allies, at least. 2015-2017 Warriors is Darkseid, though, getting help this year from diversion-distraction master Lex Luthor (KD). This one is going to be the Final Battle in terms of saving the Basketball universe.

Funny, though. Just two years ago, Warriors were as fun as Guardians of the Galaxy. If you judge them only by their playstyle, not stars or personalities or narrative - the very thing I did with the whole Superman vs Villains comment, sigh... - , they're actually wayyy more fun than watching the Cavs - passing, defense, offense...Everything is almost top-notch. Purely from an aesthetic standpoint, I prefer streaming Warriors games than Cavs games.

440,"It's amazing how many people in here still don't get what he's saying.

Dude was homeless for stretches as a kid.  One year he missed over 100 days of school in like 3rd grade.

If you've ever been that poor, when you don't know where lunch is coming from, when the people around you are dealing drugs to get by, when you don't really believe there's a future for you as a little kid it's fucking HARD to even want to try to break that cycle.  

That he's become a good person, with a stable family and is a father to his kids, things he never had as a kid, he has won at life.  His kids have it so much better off than he did as a child, and to me that is success.

I've been dirt poor, getting $4 out of my piggy bank as an 8 year old so mom could go buy a pack of bologna and bread for us for the week.  My kids have never experienced anything close to that, and won't.  I'm not wealthy at all but graduated college and have a good career and my kids will never be poor like I was and I think I've won at life.  

Anyway, I get where he's coming from.

LeBron is already a folk hero, a story so crazy that if you wrote it as fiction people would have a hard time taking it seriously.  Poor kid from the area raises up to be one of the best players ever, leaves and breaks everyone's hearts, then comes home and fulfills his promise to bring a championship to Cleveland for first time in 60 years, and while doing all that is a model citizen never in trouble with a great home life and is not only an active father but an enthusiastic one, jumping around at his kids' games.  

Point is, he's right.

It's really interesting, since I grew up watching MJ and Kobe, and I always felt that in order to be hungry/competitive you needed to have this ""dark musing"", ""all-work no-play"", ""anti-complacency"" attitude so-to-speak about yourself and your work-ethic, and here you have someone who is accomplishing all of these incredible feats but he's just literally having fun with life. I mean can you imagine a video leaking during the playoffs of either Kobe or MJ dancing around in the Gym like we saw with Lebron? I can't even fathom that. 

It's just so weird and awe-inspiring at the same time.

For instance 2011, where they played the Sixers, Celtics and Bulls (LeBron was amazing in all three of those series, BTW) he had some better plays than this, such as the 3 vs. Boston. Additionally, in 2012 where they beat Boston, he had the long 3 in game 7 to seal the deal, not to mention the tip dunk in game 6, and the sweetest turn around jumper ever in game 6. Not to mention the series vs. OKC where he hit impossible layups over Ibaka.

In 2013, the most important play of that series outside of Ray's 3 was LeBron's huge mid range GW over Kawhi.

2015, that GW over Jimmy was good, but his block of D Rose was superb, it literally saved them the game.

542,"I felt it's because all three have gotten to the rim very easily this postseason, more easily than pretty much anyone ever has in the playoffs.  But, then I looked at the numbers and each is doing it in a specific way
Curry is shooting great from everywhere.  He is literally on fire inside the arc, but he is shooting over 55% of his shots from three.  
0FT-3FT = .561  
3-10 = .611  
10-16 = .579  
16->3PT = .650  
3PT = .431    
Lebron is absolutely dominating the rim, taking over 41% of his shots from inside three feet.  He's also been amazing at three's, and it's been about 28.5% of his shots from there.  
0FT-3FT =  .775    
3-10 = .444  
10-16 =  .267  
16->3PT =  .448  
3PT = .421    
KD has the most normal distribution of shots of the three.  He's been really consistent everywhere, and it helps when on switches he can completely ignore defenders while jump shooting.  KD takes about 30% of his shots from three, 24% from inside three feet, and the rest in the middle.  
0FT-3FT = .692    
3-10 = .478  
10-16 =  .536  
16->3PT =  .727(WTF)

Jordan is undeniably the guy you want the ball in their hands to take the last shot. On the other side, LeBron is the guy you want getting the ball there, and setting up the shot for Jordan to take.

825,"This is why I think it's unfair to Kyrie when he gets shit on for his game and not being a top point guard.

To me, yes consistency is important, but so is the ceiling of your game. The ability to go out and light up an opponent in the conference finals and finals and single-handedly winning a game is a very unique and important skill. 

I don't know where that puts Kyrie in the overall point guard conversation, but I don't know how many point guards in the entire league can do what Kyrie did last night. 

Also, this may be an unpopular opinion, but I think Kyrie has been LeBron's best teammate in the playoffs, other than 2011 Wade. I think he's that instrumental to the Cavs' success. 

Also, fun fact, Pau Gasol scored above 30 in a playoff game three times between 2008 - 2010 (36 was highest in his first ever playoff game with the Lakers) and NEVER in the conference finals or finals. 

Kyrie has scored over 30 (and 40 twice) 8 times just in the last two playoffs seasons (including this one).

It's kind of irritating that most people act as if LeBron is single-handedly carrying these Cavs teams to the finals, when Kyrie has been huge in several big games.
