175,"Vernon doesn't make the strongest argument here and uses some arbitrary figures, such as the top 5 pick cut-off and only focusing on rings instead of contention. But if you listen to the full pod, his general point that ""blowing it up"" is not always the best option for teams stuck in the middle of the pack, such as the Grizz, is correct. Tanking does require luck. The Thunder are the best example of tanking and building through the draft gone right. The 76ers took longer than I'm sure everyone involved wanted, but they seem to be on the right track now. It's working for Washington as well.

It certainly hasn't worked for the Hornets though. They've reached playoff contention the past few years because Kemba turned into an all-star and they made some decent trades/signings. It also hasn't worked at all for the Pelicans. They got their superstar, but nothing else through the draft. The Kings have had no recent success as well.

When you're a low-tier playoff team like Grizzlies with all-star caliber players like Gasol and Conley, tanking isn't necessarily the smartest option to turn your team back into a top contender",27,iretalia16,/r/nba/comments/7gooxv/chris_vernon_on_does_tanking_really_help_you_win/dqkm66b/,dqkm66b,1512099449.0,1512070649.0,"Chris Vernon on does ""Tanking"" really help you win: In the last 20 years, the only top 5 picks that actually won a title for the teams that drafted them are - Lebron, Tim Duncan, Kyrie, Wade.",101,7gooxv

That is so fucking stupid. He's getting a foul called almost equally as often as he drives.  

I do not like the way refs are reffing shit this year. They're rewarding jump shooters drawing fouls and punishing people trying to score at the rim. This is the opposite of what I thought the ""Harden Rule"" was going to do. I don't see why anyone would want this. Guys like LeBron and Russ should get the foul doing what they do, but I feel like Russ gets more foul calls when he gets tapped on a jump shot than when he gets hit on the head driving into the paint.

520,"I remember sitting in row 8 in a Raptor's game (during his 1st stint with the Cavs) when Bosh's girl & cousin were jawing at him (heckling cause of a missed dunk among other things).  The Cavs were down 18 going into the 4th (iirc, it was huge anyway)... and I remember thinking ""who the hell are those two? they really should shut up"".  Well, low & behold... he gets pissed off.  He proceeds to play like nothing I've ever seen (remember this is ~2008-2009).  

He not only was his driving-to-the-basket self, but he started pulling waaaaay behind the 3 point line and splashing 3s (this is before Steph was a thing remember). It blew my mind... I'd seen Jordan at his peak, but this was unheard of and something unimaginable.  

So having seen what crazy 3 Lebron looked like then, he'll be a site to behold.  If he can maintain this type of shooting, he's have the shooting of Curry, with the vision of Magic and the driving ability of Jordan. GSW, already beating the Cavs only because they can outscore the Cav's bench, will have to hope they can outscore that bench by a bigger factor than they did last year.

Also there was no better team IMO to humble them than the Mavs, a team full of vets that no one gave a chance and most people just knew that Miami would win within 5 games. Also if the Heat won in 2011 does LeBron still have the same meltdown performance in the Finals? If thats the case then D-Wade would have won Finals MVP and most people would have just said LeBron got carried in that Finals because of how bad he played, and that wouldn't have looked good for his legacy despite the fact that he won a ring.

555,"Image wise? I would say not completely with the way he acts.

LeBron and Kobe are on a whole different level. I think those two having gone straight from HS and Bron having tons of media coverage early in his life, they learned the ropes of how to act and express themselves in public.

Kevin is 29 and he can still act petty and childish, and as a 29 year old myself, it can be hard to get rid off certain personalities if you've lived like that your whole life.

As a player, I think he can recover. He'll be up there when it comes to accolades and records. Will it change people's perception of him? Prolly not til he leaves the Warriors. Being in that team, he will always be attached to the ""You were up 3-1 in the WCF, lost/choked then joined them in the summer.""

He was still the biggest villain in the league his entire tenure in Miami.  It improved when he went to Cleveland. Then everything shifted and his entire narrative changed. 

It became the classic redemption story. And then, carrying his team without Kyrie and Love and losing in heartbreaking fashion to the Warriors. Then, the next season facing the even better Warriors in the finals and being down 3-1. And winning? That shit isn't even real life. 

Kobe just redeemed himself by being better than everyone else and staying on the same team his entire career. The Lakers being the Lakers certainly helped.

    The Internet was alive with a gleeful debate about whether Durant had a second, secret Twitter account. That wasn't the case, he told me. He did write the posts, but on his own account, he said. He described it as a dissociative episode: He woke up from a nap, and “it just felt like I was on the outside looking in at a conversation. I had to walk in and just be like, ‘Nah.’”

This is by far the dumbest part of the entire episode - he's blaming this thing on an out of body experience. It's unreal to me.

705,"He is 9,137 points away currently from Kareem. If he averages 28 ppg for the rest of this season (currently averaging 29 ppg) and plays 75 games total (his average the last two seasons), he will be 7,450 points away.

Assuming he averages ~22-24 ppg during his age 34 and 35 seasons and plays 75 games. That has him around 4.5k points shy of Kareem. Assuming he takes an even bigger dip and averages around 17-20 ppg in age 36 and 37 seasons. He'll score around 1300 points each season and he will be just 1.5k short of Kareem by his 38th season. For his 38th and 39th season, all he would need to average is 11 ppg to be the #1 scorer all time. 

If he were to somehow maintain a constant scoring average until he retires.  He would need to play until he was 40 and average 17 ppg.",582,Juniper41,/r/nba/comments/7dwpl0/lebron_is_750_points_away_from_reaching_30k/dq0v2b7/,dq0v2b7,1511077672.0,1511048872.0,"LeBron is 750 points away from reaching 30K points.

He'll probably take one game off for rest between now and then putting his target date to join the 30k club on Jan 20 at home against the Thunder. My guess would be somewhere around the 3 minute mark of the second quarter.


Edit: my official guess is at the 3:47 mark with a vicious fastbreak dunk in typical Lebron fashion.

>Q: What’s your two cents on the Cavs?

>A: “Uh, they’re struggling.”

>Q: Would you be panicking if you were one of their fans?

>A: “To a certain extent yes. And to a certain extent, no. I don’t think anyone should be panicking 12 games in, or 13 games in. However, there are some glaring concerns with them. And at the same time, you’re missing a 30-point (per game) player (in Thomas) on the bench who’s hurt. So my concern would be that LeBron is playing so many minutes right now (James, in his 15th season, is leading the league in minutes at 38.1 per game; it’s his highest mark since the 2010-11 season).
“Yeah, he’s super human but eventually his super human powers go away, so that would be more of my concern if I’m a Cavs fan or somebody with the Cavs or a player, is like ‘Man, he’s been playing a lot of 40 minute (nights) and it’s only Nov. 12.’ But I wouldn’t be pressing the panic button just yet. At the end of the day, they know how to win. They’ve got a guy who knows how to win, so I wouldn’t necessarily press the panic button. I would see certain things and I would panic about those certain things, just because…I don’t think nobody should be playing 40 minutes a game in November  (James has played 40-plus minutes in six of his 14 games).",51,aksumighty,/r/nba/comments/7d8e91/yahoo_sports_draymond_green_cavaliers_fans_should/dpw4d3e/,dpw4d3e,1510832087.0,1510803287.0,"[Yahoo Sports] Draymond Green: Cavaliers fans should worry about LeBron James’ workload, not slow start",577,7d8e91

900,">Q: Shout-out Cavs?

>A: “Right? And so once you miss that process, and now all of a sudden you think, 'Oh, it's that time and we're just going to turn it on,' then something happens and you just don't finish it. And so what I'm moreso concerned about is that, yeah, we know at the end of the day that it's a long season, and you've got to somewhat pace yourself. But at the end of the day you've still got to go through that process. And I think we're doing a good job of that now as opposed to the first five or six games. 

>Q: What’s your two cents on the Cavs?

>A: “Uh, they're struggling.” 

>Q: Would you be panicking if you were one of their fans?

>A: “To a certain extent yes. And to a certain extent, no. I don't think anyone should be panicking 12 games in, or 13 games in. However, there are some glaring concerns with them. And at the same time, you're missing a 30-point (per game) player (in Thomas) on the bench who's hurt. So my concern would be that LeBron is playing so many minutes right now (James, in his 15th season, is leading the league in minutes at 38.1 per game; it’s his highest mark since the 2010-11 season).

>“Yeah, he's super human but eventually his super human powers go away, so that would be more of my concern if I'm a Cavs fan or somebody with the Cavs or a player, is like 'Man, he's been playing a lot of 40 minute (nights) and it's only Nov. 12.' But I wouldn't be pressing the panic button just yet. At the end of the day, they know how to win. They've got a guy who knows how to win, so I wouldn't necessarily press the panic button. I would see certain things and I would panic about those certain things, just because…I don't think nobody should be playing 40 minutes a game in November  (James has played 40-plus minutes in six of his 14 games).
