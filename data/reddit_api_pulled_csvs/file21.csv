Yes you're technically paying to watch Cavs vs Warriors, but in reality the inflated price reflects Curry, Durant and Lebron in there. Without them it wouldn't fetch nearly that much money.

Pop resting guys was based on guys getting nagging injuries in their mid-30s.

Sure, LeBron could probably say ""no, I'm playing tonight"" and he'd be on the court however many minutes he wants, but the coaches are saying ""data shows our odds of postseason success increase and odds of injuries decrease if you rest these particular games."" there's a bit of strategy to not showing your hand against top tier opponents as well, but that's a hidden factor we don't have definitive evidence for or against. Just last year, the Warriors players were controlling the rest schedule because they wanted to get to 73-9. This year, Kerr made them rest, they didn't all choose the same night. 

Tl;dr the flak should go to the coaches for choosing to sit players for nationally televised games. But really the schedule is to blame.

We're told he's inefficient, our only memories - for most of us, including myself - are of him being inefficient, and we constantly compare him to guys who are incredibly efficient - i.e. Lebron - so we come to the conclusion he is.

183,">Prime Kobe from 2006-2010 had some of the best TS% of anyone doing jumpshots as their main weapon 

This is basically the meat of why the perceptions skewer Kobe a bit. 2-point jump shooting off the dribble *is* a fundamentally inefficient way to play basketball(caveat: this does shift era-to-era a bit, but the pure math of it is what it is). It just is. You basically *have* to be Kobe-tier good at it for it to not be and even then it will still look inefficient next to being a spot-up three point marksman, dominant center or runaway freight train.

One summation of Kobe's play style that is part-shade and part-commendation is ""He could take a shot in any situation and have it go in 45% of the time"", sounds a bit like shade on the surface but when you consider how Kobe played and the shots he could get off, under just about any context from any position on the floor and the ridiculous degree-of-difficulty in his shot *creation* and it's hard to think of many other guys who get it done that way. Paul Pierce said of Kobe once that people don't respect just how difficult it is to even get as many shots of as he even does and the fact that he puts so much pressure on a defender every single time he has the ball has a cumulative effect across the course of a game. At times, it almost would seem like Kobe *preferred* to make a shot more difficult than it needed to be. 

Ultimately, the body of work speaks for itself though and really you get to a certain level of the sport and it basically becomes pointless to talk about best/better when it's more often just different paths to the same/similar ends.

They’ve picked fourth four times (Corky Calhoun, John Shumate, Alvan Adams, Dragan Bender), fifth twice (Walter Davis, Alex Len), sixth once (William Bedford), seventh twice (Tim Perry and Luol Deng, who was sold to Chicago) and eighth twice (Gary Gregor, Mike Bantom).

202,"Casting judgment on whether the Lakers' ""nailed"" their recent high-lottery picks seems premature given that D'Lo is 20 and Ingram is *19* and won't turn 20 until, I think, September. And he's already improved significantly since the start of the season, averaging ~15pts on 54% over the past handful of games. And as far as Julius is concerned, I think if that draft were redone Julius probably move *up* a spot or two, so the Lakers did well with what they had. D'Lo's career could go either way and I have to say I'm not sure when was the last time I've seen not just a Laker but a player in general that I was as on the fence on as whether they have the potential to be damn-good, or are just another guy. Admittedly I'm in the camp that leans towards the latter but to act like the book has already been written on him at 20 is ridiculous. 

On the other hand, do you think in any universe Simmons' would call Jaylen Brown a missed pick at this point in his career? I like Simmons as a writer and reading his stuff is something of a guilty pleasure considering my own fandom but dammit if he doesn't come off as childish with how often he makes reference to the Pats that serve no purpose other than to boost his sport's ego, almost like he lives vicariously through his teams and their success, and with how often he takes swipes at the Lakers. Oh look, another Adam-is-going-to-rig-it-for-the-Lakers joke, four years running.

279,"It's June 2024. Game 1 of the NBA finals. The Timberwolves have home court advantage against the Cleveland Cavaliers. This season has not been easy for Cleveland, they had trouble dispatching Milwaukee in 7 games, led by the 2 time MVP Giannis Antetokuompo and 5xAll star Thon Maker. Kyle Korver, now a head coach of the Cavaliers, had significant problems adjusting the rotation after the blockbuster trade that happened the night of the draft. LeBron James the first player-GM in league history traded 6x Champions Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving, along with James Jones and their 1st round pick for the Lakers no.1 pick in the 2023 draft, selecting his son, LeBron James jr. from Ohio State. LeBron James jr. is dubbed to be the next Ben Simmons, just less injury prone. Korver however, has to adjust for the fact that the young superstar rookie doesn't have the shooting touch Love and Irving had. LeBron sr., now leading the league in 3pt percentage works hard with his son the entire season, and improvement comes just in time for the playoffs. The Cavaliers take the court for game one, the dad and son duo manning the wings, 2x DPOY Larry Sanders, though past his prime, still mans the middle. At the guards, they have 3x most improved player Buddy Hield, who LeBron traded for at the deadline, giving up draft rights for Nikola Jokić's son, which he fathered with DeAndre Jordan's sister. Point guard is their weakest position, once great T.J. Mcconnell doesn't have the same speed and defensive prowess that he once had, but he's still clutch. Facing them is a former DPOY and MVP Karl-Anthony Towns, alongside Porzingis, who they signed 3 seasons ago, they will be going head to head with the LeBrons. The veteran small forward, Chandler Parsons, who is having a career year in Minnesota will guard Sanders, a terrible offensive player. Gritty veteran Rubio, side by side with Lonzo Ball will make plays. Of course they also have 6MOY, Stephen Curry, coming off the bench, which is a big plus for them. As all prepares for a epic showdown, LeBron sr.'s and Curry's eyes lock, and LeBron silently whispers: ''Warriors blew a 3-1 lead''",289,,/r/nba/comments/5zinj5/if_lebron_plays_until_hes_atleast_39_he_has_a/deyfi6b/,deyfi6b,1489609296.0,1489580496.0,"If Lebron plays until hes atleast 39, he has a good chance of playing with his son if LBJ Jr becomes a one and done.",338,5zinj5

It was also the second highest DBPM chamionship run behind only '04 Ben Wallace.",175,Nejkulatoulinkatejsi,/r/nba/comments/5xtj6q/is_lebron_james_one_of_the_best_defensive_players/dekpqzl/,dekpqzl,1488840433.0,1488811633.0,Is Lebron James one of the best defensive players of all time?,27,5xtj6q
633,"At his peak level, absolutely. He has the quickness to stay in front of most guards and the athleticism to recover if they blow by him. The strength to handle most bigs and quick hands to strip the ball without fouling. Great conservative instincts, rarely biting on pump-fakes and rarely caught out of position, hardly ever fouls, plays the passing lanes tremendously without gambling that much. He reads the whole floor and can make lightning fast disrupting rotations when necessary, including weak side help at the rim. He rarely spends the energy to box out, and relies on his leaping ability and hands to snare contested rebounds, which he is very good at when of a mind to be, again, this depends on his urgency level, because he often gives up offensive rebounds when his matchup sneaks in behind him as a shot goes up, one of his self-admitted weaknesses. 

The thing is, he doesn't engage this defensive ability until he thinks his team really needs it. In the regular season he plays just enough defense to be a net positive - a passive glide with bursts of energy when he deems fit, to dart into a passing lane here or make a key rotation there, but without multiple efforts. In the east playoffs, he'll increase his general activity level and depending on his energy and what's going on in the flow of the game, dial it up to 10. In the Finals when the entire season on the line is the only time now where you'll see him actively give every possession the urgency it deserves, until he has nothing left in the tank. 

LeBron is one of the only players we've ever seen that's able to go from 'net positive' at his worst to 'absolute defensive force' at his best, basically at the snap of a finger. Of course, it takes a ton of energy for a guy that big to fly around the court like he can, so his defensive peak is only seen in bursts, but when engaged, he is absolutely one of the best ever.

703,"> The performances and numbers these guys are putting up are unreal and would most likely win in any other year.

I think lines like this are said every year. Realistically, every year there are a few players that are MVP worthy based on stats alone.

From a talent perspective, the Cavs are deeper than Spurs, Rockets, and Thunder when the MVP candidates are out. I'm not sure why the Cavs have such a bad record without him since talent-wise they're still damn good, but they've been losing some games they should have won with him as well. Take away Harden and Westbrook and the offenses of their respective teams become a lot less potent. Take away Kawhi and the Spurs are reliant on a mercurial Aldridge and Pop.

> So cavs keeping the 1st seed would help his case a lot.

Their current record is just a smidge above the Rockets. I don't think the Rockets should be punished because they're in a tougher conference to get the top seed.

> Lebron is at a higher level defensively than Kawhi and Westbrook too.

I agree that Kawhi has taken a step back in defense in large portions of the game as he's taken more offensive responsibility. However, the same thing has been said of LeCoast... both have great defensive ability but both choose when to put that intensity into it. Overall Kawhi has still been a better defender IMO...

> This is where I think Kawhi cannot be MVP due to his lack of play making compared to these other players. He has scored less than all 3 of them and has a much much lower assist and rebound per game mark.

Kawhi is averaging same PPG as Lebron (25.9). I agree that LeBron affects the offense more since he's an elite passer.

> Not to mention Lebron's shooting percentage and efficiency is much better than Harden's with fg% more than 0.1% better and 3P% also much better. His percentage is better in every category except FT's which is amazing consdiering Harden is thought to be a scorer and Lebron is not.

Harden's TS% being a smidge better than LeBron's shows how the shot selection (more 3s) and free throws drawn affects the offensive efficiency numbers though.",36,WD51,/r/nba/comments/5xilx9/the_case_for_a_lebron_james_mvp/deicdwl/,deicdwl,1488685234.0,1488656434.0,The Case for a Lebron James MVP,396,5xilx9
