>“There was a time in college where before practice I went to McDonald’s and I had a quarter pounder with cheese, I went to practice that day and I just remembered I felt so sluggish out there,” Allen told ProBasketballTalk. “And I was looking around thinking ‘Coach is just working us to hard’ because I just feel so tired. I ask the guys around me, ‘Do you guys feel tired? Because I just can’t move around like I want to” and everybody is like ‘no, I’m good.’

>“And I was thinking about it all practice — wow I had a cheeseburger before I came to practice, I can’t do that anymore. From that day forward I started thinking about everything I put in my body that was preventing me from performing. I started realizing it is connected.

19,"Literally everyone and their mama thought the Blazers were gonna be a lottery team, Lillard, CJ and most importantly I think Stotts, defied those odds and challenged the Dubs hard.

20,I agree. I doubt he just came out and said this quote like it is but Kerr didn't coach the whole season and Stotts took a Portland team that looked like a lottery team to the 2nd round of the playoffs.  I feel like CoY award is built for the season Terry Stotts had. ,693,LaMarc_GasolDridge,/r/nba/comments/4j36ch/lebron_james_says_terry_stotts_shouldve_won_coach/d33a1d9/,d33a1d9,1463119989.0,1463091189.0,LeBron James says Terry Stotts should've won Coach of the Year over Steve Kerr,753,4j36ch
21,"At the risk of sounding like the ""he's wrong! *my* coach is the best!"" guy (honestly, I wouldn't have minded if Stotts beat out Kerr), I think the Coach of the Year award is strange, for two primary reasons.

1) **It tends to be a ""wow, Vegas really underrated you guys"" award for a lot of people.** It's a decent mindset; I certainly didn't think Portland would be the 5th seed with the roster they have. But I think that being *too* attached to this mindset can disregard coaches who have good teams. For example, we talked about how great Stotts, Stevens, and Clifford were all season. Again, not trying to knock those guys. But it's as if Kerr, Pop, and whoever else you want to put in that group were at a disadvantage (in the eyes of some people) because ""well, it's easy to be a good coach when you have the best players"". Maybe that's true; but I don't want to knock Kerr, Pop, etc. for something they can't control (the roster they work with). The best coach is the best coach, regardless of how great their roster is. Maybe Portland gets 50 wins if Kerr coaches them? Who knows? (I get the Kerr/Walton argument, but that's a different point which I won't argue.)

2) **Do we *really* know who was the Coach of the Year?** 95% (estimate) of coaching is behind-the-scenes. I love Stevens' after-time-out plays as much as anyone, but most of coaching is at practices, shoot-arounds, film sessions, etc. Do we really have an idea of the impact a certain coach has on his team? We're not in the locker rooms, and we don't see the connections between a coach and his players. Some coaches certainly make better in-game decisions, but other than that, what do we know about coaching? It's easier to see who the better player is. A player is judged based on on-court production; a coach is judged based on that too, but mostly on preparation, practices, what have you.

I'm not trying to argue who deserves the award. I just wanted to share my thoughts on the award itself.

22,"I mean... Alot of people have this opinion so I can't get on him for saying something many of the voters felt. But I also wholeheartedly disagree with him and people who share the opinion. Whether he was present for half those wins or not, Steve Kerr is the representative of the team that won 73 wins. To me whether he was there physically for half the games when he obviously has a big hand in how the team plays on both ends of the floor doesn't take away the accomplishment. I am sure if LeBron were on a 73 win team and their head coach went through what Steve Kerr went through, he would make the case for his coach. But I won't get on him for this opinion. I hardly think its salt or hate.

Completely agree with him on that. Though I think Steph was probably both the most valuable and the best player this year, but in years past it definitely feels like the definition can change. 

Edit - Like last season it felt like Steph won it as he was best player on best team, though AD dragged an injured lottery team to the 8 seed by himself and Harden took an injured bunch of players to the 2 seed.

298,"The way I see it, Jordan is better, but lets stop using the 6 championship argument at least have a better argument like this... Put Jordan on Lebron's teams alright. He loses to the Spurs in '07, '14 and the warriors in '15. You can't honestly say Jordan puts up better numbers then lebron in those series because Lebron put up historical numbers and stil lost since he had either no team around him or injured stars. Now the one I will give to Jordan is the lost to Dallas in '11. I believe with that team Jordan doesn't lose to that mavericks team making Jordan 3-3 with the teams lebron had and lebron being 2-4. I believe Lebron could have went 6-0 as well with the teammates Jordan had around him.

609,"Is it shocking? Everybody's talking about Kyrie's assist number since... dunno, always? Since LeBron joined.

He's not _really_ a PG like some would like to see it, understanding positions like that is really reductive in 2016. He's a short guy but he plays differently than Rajon Rondo, and that's okay, to a point. He was great last year when he was effective, since there is just always a value to a guy that can both shoot and get to the basket great.

One of several reasons why I think Kyrie is currently a tough fit in the Cavs, because Delly plays with LeBron so much better. He can run a great pick-n-roll with quite a few Cavs players, and can let LeBron use his energy in other areas. Not surprised to see he has twice as many assists to LeBron as Kyrie (having only played 10% more minutes). People laugh at his skills, but he's just smarter, and LeBron is as well. LeBron generally seems to work better with smart role-players than with half-stars.

693,"> but the last quarter leading into the playoffs is a significant enough sample for me to say that Curry simply isn't the better player at this moment in time, with LeBron finding his J and returning to his Miami-level efficiency and springiness.

I agree LeBron's stats have been incredible as of late, but I don't understand this link. If Curry has been the superior player (statistically) for 3/4 of the season and LeBron for the last 1/4, how is that a significant enough sample for you to say that ""Curry simply isn't the better player at this moment in time?""


Obviously we all know about LeBron and his tendency to turn it on right before the playoffs but if I'm looking at Stephen Curry who has dominated 3/4 of the season on a 72 and potentially 73 win team, and then LeBron inching ahead with a difference of +2% TS%, -1.5ppg, +2.3 rebounds, +0.3 assists with an overall difference of +9 offensive rating, do I really hand LeBron the better player badge? Personally, no. And I don't want my reasoning to be based on anecdotal evidence, but it is *especially* hard to call LeBron the better player after seeing Curry come back into the game against the Spurs with 6 minutes left and singlehandedly decimate their defense and seal the victory -- I haven't seen LeBron dominate as effortlessly at such a big moment in recent memory.

851,"I'm actually really curious if Oscar Robertson would qualify for this. His triple double season was '61-62, with averages of 30.8/12.5/11.4. 

The first year with pace stats is '73-74, coming in at 107.8. That year, a team averaged 93.9 FGA and 25.4 FTA, so a crude measure of possessions is 93.9 + 25.4/2 = 106.6. Doesn't take turnovers into account, but close enough. In '61-62, the league averaged 107.7 FGA and 37.1 FTA, which by this measure gives 126.25 possessions per game. Cincinnati averaged 105.2 FGA and 37.1 FTA, so not too different  (123.75 possessions per game).

Scaling Robertson's stats gives:

(123.75 poss/gm) 24.9/10.0/9.3

(126.25 poss/gm) 24.4/9.8/9.1

So it would be close...

883,"TBH my initial reaction to this before I even saw the context(which was obvious that he wasn't degrading Kyrie) was that this is leadership.

I know a lot of people in this sub may disagree, but this is a snippet into how leader's lead. They do so by example, and they do so by holding each other accountable. I know that a lot if you may say that no one yells at LeBron, but perhaps that is what he's trying to instill in his teammates. He's lighting a fire within them all. 

A couple of weeks back, Bron was yelling at TT at the end of the half even though the Cavs were up 10+ points because Tristan's missed rotation ended up with the opposing team(I think it was the Celtics) getting a bucket at the end of the quarter going into the half.

And I grinned ear to ear because he's showing these young men how to become professionals, all the time--not just when it suits them. Professionalism and success in sports, hell in life, is all about repetition and good habits.

It's about being able to trust that your teammate is going to be there, the defense, like the ball needs to be on a string. I'm sure for every time he goes in on a guy, he's there praising them, too. 

How else would you explain those fly ass handshakes at timeouts and stoppages?

950,"Probably one of the only players who still has a chance to beat Kareem's all-time record, considering his early start.

If he plays the remaining 8 games of this season and ~75 games for every season he plays until he retires then here is what he'd need to average:



Seasons Played (after this season) | Required PPG
---|---
5 (36 y/o) | 30.6
6 (37 y/o)| 25.6
7 (38 y/o)| 22.0
8 (39 y/o)| 19.3
9 (40 y/o)| 17.2
10 (41 y/o)| 15.5

Maybe I'm crazy, but I don't think it's too hard to imagine a 38y/o LeBron dropping 22, or even a 40 y/o LeBron still scoring 17ppg. Not to mention he'll probably still be scoring 25+ for the next couple years.

Excited for LeBron's career when all is said is done. He's definitely going down as one of the greats, but these next few years could decide if he's 1b or ""just"" top 5. Not a bad conundrum to have, though.

**edit:**

also just checked how many seasons Durant would have to play to realistically have a chance, and it's crazy how great LeBron is. If Durant played until he was 36 (9 more seasons) he'd have to average 30.8ppg. If he played until he was 40, he'd still have to average 21.3.

953,"It's crazy how much my opinion fluctuates. I loved him his first years in Cleveland - hometown hero single-handedly dragging a garbage team to the playoffs and even the Finals, putting up just insane numbers, but always falling short (I have to imagine this is what it was like for non-Bulls' fans in the 80's). The second he went to Miami to team up with Bosh and Wade, the hate came on strong. Not because I thought it was ""wrong"" for him to do that, but just the whole circus and entitled attitude that came with it. Rooted hard against him during the Heat years. Then, when he announced he was coming back to Cleveland to play with Kyrie, Wiggins and the other youngsters, I felt the love coming back. But then, he traded the entire team (other than Kyrie) for a bunch of veterans, trying to create another ""superteam"" and I hated him even more.
