10,"> ""One of my coaches used to always tell me that when you make mistakes, you've got to face the music,"" Lillard said on Thursday, when asked about the tweets. ""In college, me and some of my college teammates were messing around. I was the obvious Miami Heat fan and they wanted Dallas to win and I made some comments about LeBron that was uncalled for. And that just goes to show that a lot of kids now on the social network, a lot of the stuff that you put out there, you never know when it can come back. So my advice to them is to be careful with that.

**Edit:**

More Bosh quotes: 

>""**There's no hard feelings** or anything,"" Bosh said. ""If we're both trying to win, he's against us, and that's a matter of fact.""

This isn't personal, Bosh said, and he reinforced it by recalling a gift he and his wife, Adrienne, recently sent James.


>""He had a baby shower, and we sent him a gift for his daughter,"" Bosh said. ""Then training camp started, and that was about it.""

Clarifying comments he made Tuesday, Bosh said he did speak with James briefly at Dwyane Wade's wedding Aug. 30.



>""My time is backwards and everything, but **we talked**,"" Bosh said. ""I want people to understand I'm a competitor, and he's on the other team. I think he'd understand that, and I understand that, and that's how it is now.""



>""**It's going to be special to see those guys on Saturday**,"" he acknowledge. ""But both teams are here to work. I'll acknowledge those guys for sure, I'm still cool with all of those guys. It's really not a story, it's what people make it. **I just made a decision like a lot of people made decisions this summer**.""

158,"I don't like this question one bit. First, you have to look at Kawai and Iggy's defense. Their stock on their teams has alot to do with their defensive prowess. On the other hand, you have Rudy Gay fitting in nicely in the King's offense and averaged 20pg while grabbing 6 rebs. I mean Kawai didnt even get to 13ppg while Iggy didn't even scratch 10ppg. They are two different types of players, iggy and Leonard have the hustle/spark while Rudy just SCORES. 

Because of this reasoning, my choice is Batum. This man is a sleeper pick and fully deserves being recognized for his contributions to the Blazer team last year. Whatever you needed, this guy would bring it. He averaged 13ppg on a team with Ice Cold Lilliard and the Post-master Lamarcus Aldridge, not to mention Wesley Mathews conjuring pretty much his best year. Along with those points, he grabbed 7 rebounds and more than 5 ASSISTS A GAME. Let me repeat that, he rebounded more at his position than anyone not named Carmelo and is 3rd in dishes to LeBron and Kevin. He also shoots his FTs at 80% and is arguably the best hustle defender on the Blazers. Batum was just flat out productive in every aspect of the game last year.

Between the two, both have good arguments. But I got to go Iggy because he is more versatile overall.

Once you go to the Finals 4 straight times and win 2, it becomes really taxing mentally.

I think this team honestly did maximize their potential, and now both Lebron and Wade are reinvigorated with the new challenges that are ahead of them.

327,No. The 2014 Cavs moved their #1 pick to get Kevin Love because of the talent surrounding them. Trading for Garnett in '03 with Ilgauskas and Ricky Davis as the other guys doesn't entirely make sense. You take your chances with LeBron in this scenario. ,54,trreeey,/r/nba/comments/2gw5xz/do_you_think_if_the_cavs_were_in_the_same_trade/ckn2ta6/,ckn2ta6,1411188068.0,1411159268.0,Do you think if the Cavs were in the same trade scenario in the Love for Wiggins trade in 2003 do you think they would have traded Lebron for Garnett,48,2gw5xz
328,"Lebron was a much better prospect than Wiggins (who's certainly a good prospect in his own right). Plus Cleveland had a hometown connection. On the flip side, KG was easily top 3 player in the NBA at that time, and more highly regarded than Love.

I think the Cavs would be very tempted (who wouldn't be?) but ultimately say no. The primary reason being Lebron would be great for marketing purposes, and KG couldn't compete for a championship anyway on that 2003 version of the Cavs.

It's really hard to compare though. Fact is, Wiggins is not nearly as NBA-ready right now as Lebron was when he was a rookie (even accounting for the fact that Lebron was a year younger).  Lebron averaged 20/5/5 his rookie season.

498,"What's more interesting to me  is not that Curry is a close second; it's how he's a close second. 

Curry's efficiency at range stretches the defense like no one else. There's a couple points here: 1) he shoots efficiently from far away from the basket, and 2) he's one of the best shooters off the dribble. 

On the first point, he has incredible range and shoots a high percentage from it. 
http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/194107nq3c1xujpg.jpg

On the second point, Curry has one of the highest percentages shooting 3's off the dribble. In other words, he's not just a catch-and-shoot guy like Korver. As long as he has the ball, you have to stick to him.

What does this mean? Curry creates all sorts of defense-stretching situations on pick and rolls. Because of the former two points, you have to have someone on him at all times, even on a pick and roll 25 feet from the basket. This creates holes in the defense:
http://youtu.be/9XDNPWNYd6A?t=1m54s

Look at how much attention they have to pay to Curry when he's that far away from the basket, and look at the opportunity it creates for his teammates. Obviously Curry can be stopped in other ways, and Lebron is still the better offensive player. But this is a trait that's fairly unique to him, and I wish the article would have explored some of the nuances behind the numbers and what makes him and Lebron different players.

500,"Curry's x-factor on offense that can't be shown on any sort of metric is simply his ability to put entire teams' defenses on tilt when he starts getting in a groove.  His combination of very good distributing, ability to not only score, but get to any spot on the floor with ease due to his skill on and off ball, and of course, his absolutely bonkers shooting ability is on it's own tier in my opinion.  Yes more than Durant, more than Melo, more than Harden, I think on any given night no other player can put all five players on the opposing team on tilt as well as Curry can.

Edit: To help justify my post a bit, I don't think anyone in the NBA gets double teamed 23 feet out both on AND off the ball like Curry does.

>There have been instances when such box-score-based metrics fail to tell the whole story, and players with gaudy combinations of usage and efficiency don’t always have the impact we’d predict from their individual stats. These are the kinds of incongruities that ESPN’s Real Plus Minus (RPM) is supposed to detect. 

I literally just did a [post about RPM a few days ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/2d5le3/stats_101_plusminus/), and not only is it pretty poorly designed, but a big portion of the final RPM comes from box score stats, so this doesn't really make any sense haha. It also takes weighted values of performances from the previous 3 seasons, so it doesn't really make sense to compare Curry (who really took off in the 12-13 season) and LeBron with RPM.

***

Four factors uses OLS which means it doesn't take into account the multicollinearity between the factors (more ORB means higher FG% for example). Endogeneity is also present (FGA is part of the denominator in 3 of the 4 factors for example). All of this just means that Four Factors won't be able to isolate the impact of each individual factor and our final numbers will be really unreliable.

Overall the article doesn't really provide any thing insightful I feel. This is a summary of what is said:

Curry is a better shooter, LeBron is a better finisher (and is thus more efficient), Curry distributes more and commits more TOs (which we kind of would expect just based on their respective roles) and LeBron draws more fouls.

***

This is kind of the general consensus, so I don't really see what the article adds. ",21,,/r/nba/comments/2dgzuj/stephen_curry_isnt_better_than_lebron_on_offense/cjpg81r/,cjpg81r,1407995042.0,1407966242.0,Stephen Curry Isn’t Better Than LeBron On Offense — But He’s As Close As Anybody,241,2dgzuj

Not everyone could have done what Bosh did, going from a great low post player to an outside shooter simply to keep the paint clear for LeBron.  In short, LeBron is so good that he should dominate possessions, some players might have a problem with that.  

One reason Love is so perfect is that he really is two very different players, one a terrific rebounder and low post player, the other a very good spot up three point shooter who can always get his shot off.  In neither role does he need to start the play with the ball in his hands.  So he can adapt to LeBron, LeBron doesn't just have to adapt to him.  Love is also one of the best outlet passers in history, can you imagine how often he'll pass it down court to LeBron?

Hes going to be on a team now that can carry more of the offensive weight  in the regular season (kyrie/klove/waiters) so he may not have to put down as huge numbers/minutes. I wouldnt be surprised if his offensive total stats went down and his defensive went up. Then come playoffs he can take over offensively if need to and win some finals MVPs. I just think with these younger stars coming up (durant already beat him once) like blake griffin potentially, steph curry, rose again, it might be difficult to win. Especially when someone like steph basically is the offense for his team (like rose was for us when he won).

*For the current guys, I'm excited. I 
love Kyrie. I feel like he could be one of the best point 
guards in the league. Dion...I love the chip on his shoulder. I'm 
looking at it as a positive and looking forward to getting with 
him.*

*I love how active Tristan is, both rebounding, setting 
screens, and finishing at the rim. Obviously, I don't have to 
comment on Andy. You give me nine Andys, and I'll be the tenth 
guy, and we can win.*

*And James Jones from my days in Miami, to be able to 
bring on champions, that helps a lot in the locker room. It 
helps out on the floor because we've been there.*

*The early reports is that we're going to acquire 
Kevin Love. Obviously, it's not -- we can't get too far into 
it because of the league rules, things of that nature. We 
don't know for sure. I'm not getting my hopes too high on it 
right now because I don't know what could happen from now until 
...the 23rd. At the 23rd mark, if 
he comes aboard and he signs, I can tell you I'll be very 
excited to have him. He's one of those guys -- I don't even 
care about the 26 and 12. I care about the basketball IQ. His 
basketball IQ is very, very high. 
I had the opportunity to spend 32 days with him on 
the 2012 Olympic team. I always told him -- it's funny. I 
always told Kevin Love, like you're very good, man. Like he 
always thought I was kidding... gassing him a little bit. 
He was a big reason we won the gold medal with 
myself, Tyson, and Kevin Love. I'm looking forward to it.*

869,"What is tampering?

Tampering is when a player or team directly or indirectly entices, induces or persuades anybody (player, general manager, etc.) who is under contract with another team in order to negotiate for their services. The NBA may impose suspensions and/or fines up to $50,000 if tampering is discovered, however the league's practice has been to wait until a team lodges a complaint before investigating (but that's not to say they don't continue to monitor the league and won't take action independently if they discover that tampering has occurred). Here are some examples:

The Miami Heat were discovered to have tampered with Pat Riley in 1995 by negotiating with Riley while he was the head coach of the New York Knicks. The Heat ""settled,"" and avoided league-imposed penalties, by compensating the Knicks with $1 million and their first round draft pick in 1996.
After Will Perdue left San Antonio in the 1999 offseason to sign with Chicago, he commented to the press about the possibility of the Bulls signing Tim Duncan and/or Grant Hill in 2000. The league considered this to be tampering, and issued Perdue a warning.
You may have noticed that when general managers and other team personnel talk to the press, they are careful to avoid talking about specific players who play for other teams. They do this in order to avoid tampering. The only allowed response when talking about players under contract with other teams is to decline comment.

God damnit. Has nobody in the sports world actually read the story of the prodigal son? There wasn't anything triumphant about the prodigal son's return home. He returned home in shame because he just squandered his father's inheritance. The word ""prodigal"" means spending money and resources lavishly and in excess. The fact that he spent the money his father had given him on shit is what makes the son prodigal--not the fact that he left home and came back.

LeBron's story is not a prodigal son story. Dan Gilbert or the Cavs (if they are the analogical ""father"" in this story) didn't give LeBron some kind of parting gift to squander on his journey. They sent him away with a bunch of animosity. And LeBron didn't come back begging to be taken in like the prodigal son. Gilbert and the Cavs were the ones courting LeBron.

I kind of feel like those are incredibly important details if you're gonna really try to dress down LBJs decision. I'm also a little disappointed he didn't say anything about Gilbert. 

I think LeBron's characterization of ""going to college"" in Miami is way, way more accurate than cheating on a spouse. You chose a spouse. LeBron didn't choose Cleveland. So the jilted lover comparison only works because of how the fans he created felt when he broke up with them on TV in 2010. 

Returning to Cleveland can and will be questioned. Self-serving is probably part of the equation sure. But let's not act like it as Miami or Cleveland as his only options. He could have gone to LA, Houston, Chicago, Philly, Milwaukee, Orlando, or about every team in the league through a sign-and-trade. He is the only player in the league that has that option, and in the end he chose what feels like home. His family thinks is home. He is a different person than 4 years ago, but he wasn't growing up 365 days a year in Florida. If anything, I'd say LBJ is dedicated to his ""hometown"" more than 90% of the league.
