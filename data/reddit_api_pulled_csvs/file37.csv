DEMONSTRATE VALUE: local kid making the cover of magazines as a high schooler, considered to be a prodigy and possible once-in-a-generation talent.

ENGAGE PHYSICALLY: be drafted to the Cavs. Play for the team. Win 2 MVP awards.

NURTURE DEPENDENCE: Make Cleveland depend on him for taking them to the playoffs and finals. Maybe a scary economy comes along? He's there to keep people working and going to Cavs games.

NEGLECT EMOTIONALLY: Start to play with lackluster energy in the playoffs. Maybe quit on your team a little bit. Go onto national television and humiliate them.

INSPIRE HOPE: Come back a changed man. Say he didn't really appreciate being there fully because he wasn't mature enough... But now he's ready, baby. He loves Cleveland. Cleveland welcomes him back... They share a hot night of love.

SEPARATE ENTIRELY: He slips out into free agency, never to be heard from again.

378,"The culture of the Cavs is not a winning culture. In Miami, LeBron was surrounded by Dwayne Wade who learned to win with Shaq and is one of the best competitors on the NBA, Pat Riley who has been winning for generations, Ray Allen who leaned how to be a winner in Boston with KG and Pierce and especially Doc, Chalmers who was a championship player in college, etc. The culture of winning started at the top with Riley and created this winning atmosphere that LeBron thrived in.

In Cleveland, there is no winning atmosphere or winning culture. It is a culture of terrible front office management, a first year coach who is in over his head, a point guard who looks like he plays more for himself than the team, a power forward who has always been on a losing NBA team and never figured out how to win, a shooting guard who is a ball hog, and the list goes on and on. LeBron has not changed that culture. 

What successful coaches in the NBA do is create a winning culture. Look at the successful coaches in recent memory and even this year: Popovich, Jackson, Doc, Thibbs, Carlisle, even Kerr. Nobody talks about their Xs and Os, they talk about their handling of players and the culture they build. Blatt is in over his head and LeBron isn't the type of demonstrative leader to change the culture for the entire team.

It occurred to me while reading it that whether or not you like Wade as a player, or whatever criticisms you have aside, he's one of the most unique players of his generation.

- he's been one of few players to stay with the team that drafted him his entire career
- he won championships twice with HOF players that were brought in and left in a fairly short window... I can't even think of any comparable situations that have happened before
- he lead the ""redeem team"" to win gold in the Olympics in 08, making the US the dominant force in international bball once again
- he obviously is a future hall of famer when you look at his all star numbers alone
- he dealt with and arguably conquered injuries that could have cost him his career... months and months of rehab only to produce incredible numbers

I'm not even a big D-wade fan. In fact I'm overall pretty indifferent towards him. But damn it all just kind of hit me how few players can hold a candle to some of the shit he's done in the NBA.

I think he's pretty much gotten  to the point where he's on par with the Melo, Durant, Dirk, Kobe crowd in terms of mid range ability.  awesome for a guy who used to get ragged on for getting by on primarily athleticism. gonna really help his game as he gets older

Also think the talk of his athletic decline is pretty silly.  he looked reallly fast and explosive on a few of those one  man fast breaks and that tomahawk in the half court.  even if he's lost a tiny bit off his vert, he's still an absolute freakish athlete, even by elite NBA standards.

Dat cheap shot.

And I disagree that he's the best he's ever been, his shooting at the rim, mid range and from 3 are the lowest they've been in years. His defense is not elite anymore. Yes he's passing more and controlling the game which is certainly valuable but he did that before too while being an elite finisher and better shooter. The thing is that this Lebron is still the best player in the league but old Lebron was the most dominant.

606,"Unfortunately, not *everyone* loves Mike Miller. 

Not that it's Mr. Miller's fault. It's NBA 2k9's fault. I played a game against Mike Miller and I'd be willing to be he drained 12, if not 13 3's in one single game against me. I closed out the game and chose not to save vowing to come back and replay it again. Unfortunately, the same result came.

Now, I'm not a person who rages at games, and this is actually my only evidence of this happening. But I raged. I took my controller and spiked it on the living room floor. It bounced and headed towards the wall where it ricocheted and split into pieces. The battery pack went flying off of it and a double A battery hit me in the lip, splitting it. 

The legend of Mike Miller grew that day. He became a source of absolute vitriol for me. The xbox 360 controller still worked and my brother and best friend dubbed it ""Mike Miller"" for the hardships he had caused it. I still have that bright blue 360 controller to this day and while it doesn't work now, any time my brother and friend see it, they remark about the day Mike Miller became an infamous member of our gaming family.

628,"Take this with a grain of salt I guess, but the way I see it is that LeBron is too good at everything. Which sounds silly but I think has some merit.

Most players specialize in one aspect of the game, obviously most players are role players and they just do their role. But stars *also* fulfill a role, a specialization. Kevin Durant's role is to score, *a lot* but it's not his job to run the offense. Chris Paul scores but his role is to hit the open man and run the offense. Dwight Howard grabs boards and defends the paint, it's Harden's role to provide the consistent scoring threat. Kobe puts an incredible amount of pressure on a defense with his scoring, which opens up the floor for his big men to do their thing. This is true throughout history. John Stockton and Karl Malone were superstar talents, but they didn't step on each other's toes when it came to filling the offense, they ran outside/inside. Bird, McHale, and Parish were all complimentary. Jerry West scored from the outside, Chamberlain from the inside. Russell rebounded and defended, Bob Cousey or John Havlicek ran the offense.

We can even say this about Jordan. Jordan was the most phenomenal scorer to play the game, but his role wasn't to hit 3s and stretch the floor, that was Paxton's (and later Kerr's) job. He wasn't there to grab rebounds, that was Rodman's job. He wasn't there to run the offense, Ron Harper set up the triangle. When Jordan did run the offense under Coach Collins and did everything, picking up 10 triple doubles in 11 games, [the bulls put up a losing record.](http://www.interbasket.net/news/10741/2013/02/michael-jordans-streak-of-10-triple-doubles-in-11-games/) 

There are a couple of other players who fit the Swiss Army Knife mold, and they were Scottie Pippen and Magic Johnson. Pippen was successful because he put himself behind Jordan on the team's priority and made sacrifices to fill holes in the offense (and defense!) when the Bulls were weak in a specific area in any given game. Magic was successful because he took it upon himself to run the rest of the team. He could have been a small forward at 6'9 and been phenomenal, but he recognized that he could be more effective if he got others into their roles and filled in holes when needed. If Kareem was putting up 35, Magic was distributing. If Worthy wasn't grabbing boards, Magic would go do it. If Byron Scott wasn't hitting his jumpers and stretching the floor, guess who was gonna be putting the ball in the basket. He was reactive when his teammates were proactive in their roles.

James is so good that he infringes on other people's roles. It's not just that he's expected to do everything, it's that *he actually just does everything.* He commands too many resources and possessions, and instead of filling in his team's weak points, his teammates are just bodies filling in for him on the floor. We saw this on the Heat and it's exactly what Bosh is talking about. It's not that Bosh suddenly turned into a shitty scorer when he went to the Heat, it's that James is a better scorer. Why *wouldn't* they defer to James? He'd do this for any role. He's better at running an offense than Chalmers, so he'd dominate the ball (we now see Chalmers having very good games with the ball in his hands). 

James isn't about to take a secondary role as Pippen did, there's nobody good enough for him to sit behind. Even Wade, who was arguably the best 2 guard and a top 3 player for a couple of seasons, had to get behind James. He refuses to run the point and thus can't emulate Magic Johnson by providing a filler for the gaps that his teammates leave. He's so good that his teammates expect him to do everything, and if other players perform their roles and step on his toes, someone is (or multiple people are) going to have an off game.

Lebron James is a player without a role. That needs to change.",101,MrBokbagok,/r/nba/comments/2nih5j/chris_boshs_warning_about_what_its_like_to_play/cme32qk/,cme32qk,1417080048.0,1417051248.0,Chris Bosh's Warning About What It's Like To Play With LeBron James Is Coming True,149,2nih5j

650,"Lebron ""stinks"" because he is focusing so much on the ""system"" working that he isn't focused enough on his job as an individual talent on the court,

in my humble opinion, this is a good thing. 

I have an analogy. In a relationship, a lot of people may prefer to sweep any little problem under the rug. ""its not a big deal lets move past it"". but what happens later on? these problems resurface, bigger and badder. right now, i feel like lebron is basically digging into the relationship and focusing on all the flaws in such a way that he is forgetting to ""love"" his significant other, or just play ball. At some point, you stop working on the flaws and you just play the game. digging into the relationship is ugly, but in the end you have a stronger relationship than you would. right now he is the bad man, but when the Cavs finally click, he wont look so bad, people will see the focus on the ""system"" was smart for the long term",25,LostCityLeague,/r/nba/comments/2naeq2/lebron_on_cavaliers_issues_i_stink_we_got_a/cmbxjsh/,cmbxjsh,1416892664.0,1416863864.0,"LeBron on Cavaliers' issues: ""I stink"" - ""We got a four-game losing streak, so I stink,"" he said.

Even if/when guys convince themselves that they can win, to care on defense and develop the mental fortitude to withstand things not going their way, they're still short staffed on the defensive end. They can't guard the perimeter, and they have no rim protectors... They're defense is roughly as effective as a ""please do not touch wet paint"" sign. But, going into the season everybody knew defense would be an issue. 

What really perplexes me is their offensive struggles. Lebron is a tremendous passer and play maker, yet two amazing offensive players and himself are struggling to hit 100 points. The most potently offensive thing about this team right now is Dion's shot selection. Energy guys that can come off the bench and score are valuable, but Dion and his poor shots and costly mistakes outweigh the benefits he brings. His mannerisms on the court are precisely what we don't need. A package involving him to get someone who could help on the perimeter or working towards a rim protector would be godly.

And Chris Bosh had the inside track on Love playing with Lebron. He looks absolutely lost on offense. It's still very early and Rome or anything like it wasn't built in a day, but these issues are disconcerting. After all the coming home and bringing Love hype, anything short of perfect would've been scrutinized. But this is just surprisingly bad.

For the first few games of his new team, he lets his coach try to figure it out, knowing full well he can take over a game. Lebron is the ultimate bandaid for bad coaching (like Mike Brown's coaching). He is giving Blatt a chance to figure out a rotation even when Cleveland plays at its worst.
