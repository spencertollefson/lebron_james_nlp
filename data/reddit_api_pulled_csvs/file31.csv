2,Free throws are a huge part of the game. Good coaches should be able to expose players who can't make them and take advantage of their weakness. This whole argument is like making a push to forbid NFL defensive coordinators from blitzing quarterbacks who lack mobility. ,400,,/r/nba/comments/44btbw/chris_haynes_lebron_james_not_in_favor_of_doing/czp0jix/,czp0jix,1454722166.0,1454693366.0,[Chris Haynes] LeBron James not in favor of doing away with hack-a-Shaq.

3,"This is the perfect example of the flaw in the 'learn how to shoot free throws' logic all the hacking supporters throw out there. If you can't dribble, no one can take advantage of that **if you don't have the ball.** 

No one wants it so that Deandre and Drummond never have to go to the line, you just shouldn't be able to make them go there if they don't have the ball. If three point shooting is a weakness of a player, you can sag off them and take away driving lanes, but you can't **make them shoot threes.** If someone can't pass, you can double-team them, triple-team them, whatever, but you can't **force them** to pass. If someone is a terrible all-around offensive player, you can't **force** him to get the ball. 

The defense having the ability to completely dictate the way an offensive possession unfolds is not the way the game is supposed to be played. The fix is easy too, just give teams the option to take off-ball fouls out of bounds when they're in the bonus.",28,styleez,/r/nba/comments/44btbw/chris_haynes_lebron_james_not_in_favor_of_doing/czpb3gt/,czpb3gt,1454737199.0,1454708399.0,[Chris Haynes] LeBron James not in favor of doing away with hack-a-Shaq.

6,"Ok I really hope this doesn't get buried because I want to express my opinion on this.

Every skill in basketball has some way to counter it.  Bad shooters can be sagged off of but that doesn't ruin the game because they can still make plays by driving and dishing. When you can't score well you can still be elite by passing and you still have a place in the game, if you're offensive game is horrible you can still play good defence and have a place in the game. 

That being said they are all easily punishable, if you're a bad defender the other team can lock on to you on offence, if you're a shitty shooter the team can just neglect you on the perimetre. If you can't dribble well you're limiting yourself heavily on offence because the defence might steal the ball or trap you.

The thing with basketball is coaches make sacrifices when they play players no matter what, when you play Jamal Crawford you sacrifice defence in favour of scoring, when you play Tony Allen you sacrifice in the sense that your offence slightly dips due to having effectively 1 less player but you're defence flourishes. Even free throw shooting is punishable, players like DJ can be fouled when they come to the paint and it'll make it harder for them to score in general, so even free throws have their advantages and disadvantages.

Hacking however punished ft shooting too much, with bad defence you take a slight dip in defensive production and with bad offence you take a slight dip in offensive production. If you can't shoot free throws, no matter how easy they are, you essentially can't play on offence until you **LEAVE THE GAME** which makes it 20x more punishable than every other skill in basketball.

I'm not saying players shouldn't learn to shoot free throws, because believe me DJ's horrible ft shooting bothers me as well, but it's just like not being able to dribble, you shouldn't learn it because you HAVE to learn it but it should be to improve your play.

With current rules: **Every skill in basketball is optional and can be worked around besides ft shooting, which is a necessity, and that's unfair.**",37,Optism,/r/nba/comments/44btbw/chris_haynes_lebron_james_not_in_favor_of_doing/czp2ffv/,czp2ffv,1454724840.0,1454696040.0,[Chris Haynes] LeBron James not in favor of doing away with hack-a-Shaq.

7,"I love it when teams hack, personally. I think it's bizarre and abusive, and honestly it's fun watching each FT rim out and seeing if the hacking team makes a comeback for it. That's all entertaining to me. I get that it's not 'normal' or smooth bball but it's good entertainment IMO, and it happens rarely anyway. I don't get how people can be so angry over having to watch it. How about we fix the awful calls on regular plays?

49,"Since this is basically comparing the Cavs to the Heat when Lebron was there, let's look at the numbers.

Team | PTS/G | Opp PTS/G | Diff
:-- | :-- | :-- | :--
Heat '12-13 | 102.9 | 95.0 | 7.9
Cavs '15-'16 | 102.2 | 96.3 | 5.9
Cavs 01-23-16 to 01-30-16 | 108.6 | 101 | 7.6


I think the difference between the PTS/G and the Opp PTS/G is more important than just PTS/G. Even just taking the the last 5 Cav games, the Heat still had a better difference average throughout their '12-'13 season.

It took about 10 years to sort of get out of that storyline. So a lot of stuff is following him out the door. Whether it's right or wrong, it's just the nature of it.

Ballsy move, but blatt might still be coach if he stood up to lebron's bullshit. If anyone questions it, he could just shoot a question back: ""do the best two teams and their coaches, golden state and San Antonio , tolerate lazy play? Absolutely not. And neither do I. We want to be champions, like them, but it starts with effort.""",242,,/r/nba/comments/42yb9g/fedor_lebron_james_ive_never_undermined_or/cze3m1q/,cze3m1q,1453947492.0,1453918692.0,"[Fedor] LeBron James: ""I've never undermined or disrespected a head coach.""",905,42yb9g

Lue's plan doesn't seem like it would get much resistance from Kyrie, but I could see Love being worried about his ""brand"" going against second units. Maybe not his brand as much as his ego, but you only have to look as far as the better teams in the league to see how important second units are.

297,"On one hand, I find it great that LeBron has done well by his friends. Even though they have a checkered history professionally, I think it's cool that he took his friends from his childhood--[Maverick Carter, Randy Mims, Rich Paul](http://adage.com/article/news/king-s-men-lebron-james-version-entourage/110516/)--and [made them multi-millionaires right along with him](http://espn.go.com/sportsnation/post/_/id/13782831/lebron-james-friends-seeing-success-too).  He didn't forget about them and gave them amazing opportunities that they've proven to be decent enough at handling instead of leaving them behind in Akron. I think that's the life many young men dream of having with their childhood friends.  
    
On the other hand, when it comes to the basketball side of things, his desire to put friendships over business has sabotaged him. Everything he's done in Cleveland surrounded by that entourage runs counter to his supposed quest of titles. You can't overpay for Tristan Thompson because Paul is his agent, you can't turn your back on Pat Riley because he won't let Maverick on team planes, you can't favor Lue and disrespect a standing coach because you've been buddies forever.

591,"Cool stat! I wrote a quick script to go through some historical high scorers and see how many of their first consecutive seasons they increased their per-36 scoring average. All data from Basketball-Reference. Here are some results:

* Durant - 9 seasons (still going)
* Harden and Curry - 7 seasons (still going)
* Boogie and PG13 - 6 seasons (still going)
* Dirk - 14 seasons
* Ray Allen - 11 seasons
* Drexler - 9 seasons
* Karl Malone, West, and Wade - 8 seasons
* Barkley, McGrady, and **LeBron** - 7 seasons

___

Technically, in the 2010-11 season, LeBron's per-36 average was 24.81, and his career per-36 average was 24.83. But since you said ""increased *or maintained*"", I decided to give a leeway of 0.05. Here are some results with the modified criteria:

* LeBron - 13 seasons (still going)
* Durant - 9 seasons (still going)
* Westbrook - 8 seasons (still going)
* Harden and Curry - 7 seasons (still going)
* Boogie and PG13 - 6 seasons (still going)
* Dirk - 14 seasons
* Ray Allen - 11 seasons
* Drexler - 9 seasons
* Karl Malone, West, and Wade - 8 seasons
* Barkley and McGrady - 7 seasons

___
Another way we can look at it is to give each player one leeway season. So we'll track seasons until the *second* time the streak breaks. Here are the results with the new criteria:

* LeBron - 13 seasons (still going)
* Durant - 9 seasons (still going)
* Westbrook - 8 seasons (still going)
* Harden and Curry - 7 seasons (still going)
* Boogie and PG13 - 6 seasons (still going)
* Kobe - 17 seasons
* Dirk - 16 seasons
* Moses Malone - 13 seasons
* Ray Allen - 12 seasons
* Kevin McHale - 11 seasons
* Karl Malone, Drexler, McGrady, West - 10 seasons
* Barkley, Wade, Bird - 9 seasons
* Shaq, Nique, Glen Rice, Melo - 8 seasons",77,ca1294,/r/nba/comments/40plnt/lebron_has_increased_or_maintained_his_career/cywcaxg/,cywcaxg,1452693357.0,1452664557.0,"LeBron has increased or maintained his career per-36 scoring average every year of his career, including this one",428,40plnt

991,"Lebron's consistency and his health are low-key two of the most impressive things about his career thus far. I mean we talk about them of course, but still I don't think it can be overstated. We've seen a lot of players have a few amazing seasons, we've seen a few players sustain a career's worth of great performances(discarding tail ends) but Lebron's in that rarified space of a career's worth of amazing seasons and he has such a generally exceptionally insight and mind for the game that it's unlikely that changes moving forward even if/when his athleticism wanes or whatever. 

When you talk about Lebron 'getting his numbers' it is more literal than most and not generally a function of 'over the course of the season he'll average out to his numbers'",46,,/r/nba/comments/3xcxj2/lebron_james_consistency_over_the_years/cy3o1qm/,cy3o1qm,1450493385.0,1450464585.0,LeBron James consistency over the years.,1491,3xcxj2
