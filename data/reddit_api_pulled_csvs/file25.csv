> We go deep and talk about stuff and figure out where we need to go as a partnership. It's really a partnership when you think about it

&nbsp;

On their relationship after LeBron left
> I think everybody learns every day in the decisions they make and the things they do. It was just a whole different feeling from Day 1 (when James came back in 2014). Keep in mind, that we just had one bad night in five years that we were here with LeBron -- remember the first two (years that James played in Cleveland), Gordon Gund ran and owned the team. But we never had a bad day until the way it ended. And as bad as it was, it was one day, it was one night and everybody is a grown man and obviously we focused on the job here. And sometimes things happen for a reason, right? You just never know it at the time.

&nbsp;

On continuing to spend...

> There's only one direction you can go when youre on top, so you might as well stay there, right? So, we have to repeat. That's the only way to get out of it. I think everybody, after that banner goes up, will be back to business and focus on the job at hand. ...Not even a thought. Let's picture this: a little cash in the bank or a championship ring, what would you take? Not even close. I think it was my grandfather who told me that anybody that dies with money in the bank is a failure. Where are you going to take it? So you might as well invest it in the right things and try to positively impact the world as much as you can. So, that's what we believe.

Lebron's commercial feels like it is about remembering what you come from (based on his personal upbringing) and always keeping that chip on your shoulder so you stay hungry and humble.

Curry's commercial feels like it is about erasing/replacing the negative events/narratives that you get hit with as you try to succeed in your craft (which is a little weird cause he already won a championship but makes sense)

Hawks would get the go-to player they've always needed, and LeBron-Milsap-Howard would be the best frontcourt in the NBA.

177,">Just as interesting as the paths of James’s perimeter precursors, however, are the trajectories of versatile big men such as Barkley, Garnett and Robinson. Rather than losing some aspect of their skills with age and falling into a lesser archetype, the great big men most similar to James — Barkley, Malone, Garnett, Tim Duncan and Hakeem Olajuwon3 — retained their mix of valuable talents for the majority of their remaining careers. And although James himself has never been categorized among this group, the fact that a number of his similar players have (it was the second-most common classification for his comparables) and that those players ended up retaining more value from age 32 onward than their perimeter counterparts (big men averaged 52 total wins above replacement over the following five seasons, vs 36.2 for perimeter players) suggests that James’s best future could be in the paint as a big man, not out on the wing.

198,"Side note; I remember before the 2013 and 2014 seasons back when he was an analyst Steve Kerr was basically asked for some ""bold prediction"" or something along the liens. One year it was on the BS report another it was something else. You know what he said? I think somebody other than LeBron in the East makes the Finals. Side note but I think it also provides some perspective for how difficult he knows that getting to the Finals is repeatedly. 

I always find this reddit notion that going to 6 straight finals isnt that impressive because the East is so weak interesting. 

It gets back to what people dont realize: the odds of a team winning something you take for granted are way way lower than you might think. 

Going into the playoffs almost everybody had golden state winning the title. Realistically look at projections they had them maybe as having a 55% chance of winning. WE know what happened. There were projections that last year had the Cavs going into the playoffs having anywhere from 45-65% chance of coming out of the East. Almost nobody picked Cleveland to lose before the Fianls. And yet go through the projection systems you wont really find one that had the Cavs of winning the East much higher than 65% at best and potentially much lower. Why? Because winning games is way harder than people assume. Things happen that nobody ever anticipates. 

IT comes down to this: For any one season LeBron winning the East isnt that difficult. Maybe it's a 60% chance if we are going by what projections say. But 60% six straight times? This is hardly some perfect statistically sound probability calculation but 0.6X0.6X0.6 X0.6 X 0.6 X 0.6 is 0.046. Less than 5%. That in a very rough sense gives you an idea of how hard it is to do something 6 straight times reddit just takes for granted. 

Just for perspective, no matter what upset you see in the playoffs, 1 vs 8 or what not, statistical projections will almost always give them a >5% chance. Last year I think the statistical projections put Detroit's odds vs Cleveland at roughly 15%. So the Pistons who even teh biggest Pistons homer wouldnt pick to beat the Cavs in a very rough sense had a 3X higher chance of winning than LeBron did of making 6 straight finals. It's incredible to think about. IT's just so difficult to do no matter how weak your conference is. 

Me personally, just getting to 6 straight Finals is a far more impressive feat than beating that 73 win Warriors team last year. It's not even close.

218,"I think what people never bring up in the Jordan vs Lebron debate is the quality of teams Jordan faced in the Finals. 

First off, while LeBron is chastised for playing in the weaker conference most of his career, it also means Lebron saw his greatest challenge in the Finals. Conversely, Jordan played his best teams in the lead up to his chips rather than in the Finals (usually). Lebron, at least in most of his losses, can't really have his losses placed on him, especially considering how incredible he was in 2014 and 2015 and just how good the teams were in general.

What also seems to be ignored is that, relative to competition across eras, Jordan didn't face very remarkable teams. Magic and Bird faced each other multiple times, and those were stacked teams squaring off. Wilt had the Celtics destroying everyone in his day, and then he had his own amazing team when he joined the Lakers. Just going by HOFs by team, Jordan faced two with more than one HOF player: the 1991 Lakers and the 1997-1998 Jazz. However, Worthy was seriously hurt in the 1991 Finals and left Game 4 (with Scott), and Divac was a second year player (though, he was still pretty damn good in the Finals). Jordan, outside of that
the 1991 Finals, never had the disadvantage in HOF players, and he was never an underdog. 

Lebron, on the other hand, has been the underdog in every Finals except 2013 and 2011, and every Finals saw multiple HOFs on the opposing team. In the case of the Thunder, they had three future MVP candidates. It's not the best way to measure the overall quality of teams these players played with or against, but it's something to acknowledge. 

We tend to forget that Jordan, as great as he was, never actually beat the good teams in their heyday or anytime near it.  The Celtics beat him every game in the postseason. The year he beat the Pistons, they barely cracked 50 wins, and Thomas was out half the year and injured in the playoffs. Look at Jordan's stats BEFORE he made the Finals. Even the year before his first chip, Jordan experienced his fair share of bad games and coming up short in big moments. We always acknowledge how unstoppable Jordan was in his first few chips, but we also tend to disregard Jordan shooting under 47% the year before in the ECF and having a really bad Game 5 and pretty bad Game 2 in a really close series. Yheres also the 1998 ECF Game 7 and the Game 3 against the Knicks Jordan had where he csme up short, but his team won regardless. The years before were not even that good. That's not to shit on Jordan, but he did have a hard time getting through those better teams. 

The biggest issue I have with Jordan's legacy is the complete dismissal of the 1994 Bulls who came one bad call away from making the ECF against the Knicks, who were supposedly the team that would challenge he Bulls in the East. Imagine Lebron leaving and the Cavs without him. They might not even make the playoffs, and even if they did, do you think they'd make the second round? Overall, even if we can say the East is weaker, Jordan had a team that was good enough to compete there without him. 

I'm a Lebron Stan. I have a shit ton of bias in this argument. But there are quite a few overlooked facets of Jordan'shoes legacy.",45,,/r/nba/comments/57driw/lebron_vs_jordan_at_age_31/d8rmra3/,d8rmra3,1476476376.0,1476447576.0,LeBron vs Jordan at age 31,91,57driw

323,"This is expanding on something I saw someone else here comment a little while ago.

Jordan has set the bar, fairly ""unanimously"". 

LeBron (or any other player) cannot just reach that bar, they cant just put themselves in the conversation with Jordan, meaning people considering him to be just below, or even just above Jordan wouldn't be enough. 

LeBron has to go above and beyond, he has to completely surpass Jordan, to borderline unrealistic degree. Thats the reward that Jordan gets for being able to set that bar.

Legend grow stronger with age, but not forever. The same way the legends of the 60s and 70s fell to the legends of the late 80s and 90s, maybe someday in the future, another great player will have an easier time climbing the Jordan mountain.

But right now, I think Jordans legacy is just way too prominent, and LeBron is too close in the timeline to have a realistic chance of truly making the GOAT discussion a debate.

415,"From the way he set up his contract, you can kind of guess what he's thinking. I mean he's a very ""aware and attentive"" type of person. 

Option A): 3 year he signed this summer, with I'm guessing a 3rd year player op essentially allows him 2 years. Everyone assumed he was gonna go 2 year with an op after 1 year and then sign a 5 year max with the Cavs until retirement, simply waiting for the cap to jump this season. This deal essentially gives him an extra year (7 instead of 6)


Option B) Option A seems more unlikely the more you think about it for 2 reasons, mainly because the CBA is likely to change. 

1: Lebron is VP of the NBPA IIRC. He'll be involved in some capacity with negations though I don't know in what way. With KD to the Warriors, some are expecting the CBA to change to incentivize superstars to stay with their team. Whether that's being able to offer more money or 6 years instead of 5 year max, a franchise tag? I have no idea. Though, Woj talked about it some on one of his podcasts this summer. 

2: From what I've read about the cap, the only real hard cap (despite Lebron and Klutch trying to take all of Gilbert's money) the owners avoid is the repeater tax. Once the repeater tax hits, that's it - end of the expensive-superteam window, owners break the team up, etc. IIRC the repeater tax for the Cavs hits in 2018 (without future changes to the CBA or whatever). I can see him leaving to form a team with the Banana Boat in search of ""chasing the ghost who played in Chicago"" or whatever and trying to get more rings for legacy reasons. Or he could take a pay cut and stay.

420,"I feel like everyone is buying up KD's excuses for what it is. Oh yea, of course people change, what he said in the past doesn't matter. Nah

That's bullshit to me. It only changed because he is now confronted with his hypocritical statements. He's literally forced to give this excuse or else he'd have to admit he's a hypocrite.

If he never moved to Golden State, he'd never have taken his statement back. He'd never have said he changed his view. If OKC beat GSW last year and won the Finals, he'd be draping that ""loyalty"" bullshit all over himself right now. He'd be preaching that he took the hard road, stayed loyal, and got rewarded by God or some shit.

I don't believe for one second KD matured. I actually think he came off as more mature 6 years ago. In these past two seasons, he's done nothing but come off as a whiny baby. Complaining about being second his whole life. Complaining about not getting recognition. Complaining about the media. Complaining about mean comments. A few years ago, he was a nice and mature guy. Now, he's a moody little bitch.

That's my 2 cents. This is just a necessary excuse he's making. He literally can't not say ""he changed"".

Edit: Please also watch the rest of Durant's response in the video. He said he doesn't regret what he said about Lebron and he doesn't want to change it. So he is telling us that he matured and has changed. He wants people to stop criticizing him for his decision. Yet, despite the fact that he has apparently matured in his thinking and can understand why someone would make the decision he and Lebron made, he still doesn't regret criticizing Lebron using his younger and less mature way of thinking. And he doesn't want to take back that statement or change it in anyway. He's saying, yea, screw other players for taking the easy way to a championship, but I'm mature now, so stop criticizing me.

Giving Riley ""credit"" for any of this is ridiculous. There is no master plan here. It's a situation that sucks all around, but the HEAT are in the unenviable position of being liable and responsible for playing a player that no doctor will clear. They literally cannot do that.

>Like a lot of top players, you just have to hope LeBron isn’t feeling it the night you face him. Once he takes his first step off the dribble, if he gets to the side of you, there’s no staying in front of him. He’s just too strong when he gets his shoulder into your chest. And he’s also one of the best finishers with his left and right hand that this league has ever seen.

>And when he’s not physically dominating his opponents, he can also pick your team apart with his passing.

>His style of play just wears you out over the course of a game. He’s constantly drawing fouls and getting and-one opportunities. The only way to stop LeBron from getting an and-one is to straight up tackle him. Slapping down on his hands simply won’t work — he’s too strong.

>He’s just a caliber of physical specimen that this league has never seen before. A lot of the other guys I talk about on this list are tall, wiry, skinny athletic types, but LeBron is just as athletic as they are, but he’s also stronger and faster.

The average age of these 5 is 27.2, and the average age of an MVP (edit to clarify: since 1955-56), according to bbref, is 27.2. So I'd call the NBA at this point ""exactly normal.""

The only one who might be called a youngster is Kawhi, and all the other guys are right in their prime years at 27 or, in LeBron's case, just past their peak. The only time I can remember the MVP race coming down to two older players was 97-98, when Malone and Jordan were both 34.

716,"Top playoff LeBron games to me 

1) Game 6 vs Boston 2012 

Always will be the best one to me. He would have put up 60 if the game wasn't decided so early on. People forget just how much backlash and pressure he faced going into this game. 

2) Game 6 vs GS 2016

This was basically a better version of the 07 game. Put up 25 straight to take the game over in the second half, was a monster on defense, completely got in GS's head and did all of it while Kyrie got hurt and was very limited. 

Just complete King Kong mode. 

3) Game 5 vs Det 2007

Always will be an all time classic. That was a nasty ass Pistons defense he showed up. 

4) Game 5 vs GS 2016

Just did it all in the biggest moment. Would have been so easy to lay down after Game 4 when the series looked over. 

5) Game 7 vs Boston 2008

This was a legendary defense and in the biggest game on the road they could not do anything at all to stop him. All Boston could hope was he missed. Whenever he drove to the basket, he embarrassed that defense. 

6) Game 3 vs Atlanta 2009

The forgotten game, probably his best basketball showing if you don't count magnitudes of games. 

7) Game 1 vs Orlando 2009

Against a top 3 defense put up 49 pts and 8 assists on 20/30 shooting. I dont know how that's possible. 

8) Game 4 vs Orlando 2009

God this series was every bit as good as what we would see out of Jordan. 38/8/8 against the league's best defense that year and hitting a buzzer beater that prevented them from getting swept. 

9) Game 7 vs SA 2013 

One of the best coaches of all time dared him to shoot. He did. He made his shots to the tune of 37/12/4 on 12/23 from the field in the biggest game you can have in the NBA. 

10) Game 3 vs Boston 2010

Another forgotten game, he truly terrified and embarrassed Boston. This is what Jordan would do to opponents. You could see it on the Celtics faces. Game was over after the 1st quarter. 38/8/7 on 22 shots, if the game hadnt been over so soon he would have put up 50+ 

11) Game 4 vs BK 2014

Paul Pierce looked so old and humiliated in this game. It was incredible to watch. 

12) Game 3 vs GS 2015

40/12/8 dominating a 67 win champion with a total goon squad. Basically ran the Belair offense. Wasn't that efficient, but 14/34 shooting with that supporting cast against such a good defense really isn't too shabby. 

Edit: Somebody wisely pointed out to me LeBron's Game 4 vs Indy deserves mention. I would in fact probably put it at 10) on this list in hindsight.

766,"Alright you shits, time for ol' papa to give you the recipe for success.
You say you got a woman coming in your house and you say you can't cook? Why you even invite her anyway? What the hell you gonna do boy?

1. **Appetizer**:
You gonna need to prepare for the main course my man, you finna butter her up and get her ready for whats coming. Buy some white cheese, or if you don't have that buy some feta cheese, that will work. You gonna bake that motherfucker. But the whole block of cheese in the oven. Wait. Slice up a tomato and some pepper, make them nice long slices. Decorate that cheese, make it look like a god. Add some olive oil on top of it, add some spices, oregano, basil is the shit. Then put it in the oven. Make it bake, bake that motherfucker until you can see the black overbaked corners. Serve.

2.  **Main Course**:
Alright boy you gonna need some sweet lovin' for this one. This shit will knock it out the ball park. Get a whole turkey or a whole chicken. She gonna be askin' for your D after this meal boy. 
Ain't nothing that's hard to cook. Buy some vegetables, peas, carrots, maybe some peppers, broccoli, a bit of corn and mushrooms (Add some bacon if you are a meat lover like me and for that sweet fat). We gonna make the stuffing now oohh yes we are! Cook that bacon and them mushrooms in a pan, make sure the bacon is nice and crispy. Alright now boil the peas, corn, carrots and broccoli. Good. They nice and boiled? Put them in a bowl, mix it up with the bacon and mushrooms. Now we gonna do the chicken/turkey. 
Put your chicken in a nice big deep baking tray. Spice that fucker up with some salt n' peppa. You wanna have that crispy chicken/turkey look don't you? Well get some crushed red pepper and you gonna gently cover the whole chicken/turkey in that shit. I want you to massage it, make it feel the sexual seduction you are imposing it. Make it your bitch. Now go and add your stuffing, fist that fucker in, the whole of it. 
You gonna need 200-300ml White Whine put that in the baking tray with the chicken/turkey. Add 100ml water. Oven should be heated at 200 D Celsius. Cover the chicken/turkey with a aluminum foil and put it in the oven for 1 hour. After the hour, we gonna do the crispy skin now. Take it out, remove the cover and put it right back in for 30 minutes.
After it's done take it out the oven. Be generous with the turkey/chicken you don't wanna fuck up now do you? Take it out the tray, put it on some serving shit you have. Remove the stuffing and serve it beside the chicken/turkey.
Serve. Watch some videos on how to properly cut a chicken/turkey, don't emberess yourself boy. Cut that chicken for your lady. She gonna be wet when she sees what kind of gentleman you are. Shiit, you gonna be drowning in that pussy.

3. **Desert**:
Get some ice-cream. I mean those 3 flavor ice-creams that only rich white people buy. Get those cool ice-cream scoops, they about 1-2 dollars. Scoop that cream and put it nicely in a dish, add some whip cream and some chocolate dressing. You can add some cinnamon on top for extra detail and also grate some chocolate on that.
Now boy, you a man that know how to cook. 

Also don't overfeed yourself, you gonna need space to eat that pussy later.

918,"In high school, I started a handball league in my hometown during the summer, and it ended up running for 3 seasons. We had ten teams and over a hundred people playing from all sorts of ages. The game we were playing wasn't quite handball, due to some limitations we had, but it sure gave me a love of the sport. It's hard to follow in the U.S. because there's absolutely NO presence in this country, and almost no attempt for the European teams to market to us. Games with English commentary are few and far between, and even then they narrate the action moreso than they actually explain anything that's going on. It's hard to grasp for a newcomer and it's hard for Americans to get into.

I would fucking love to see America get into this sport. EVERY OLYMPICS it gets brought up that we are terrible at handball despite being made to play it. Anyone who watches this game thinks it is awesome and entertaining. I've never met anyone who's watched handball highlights and said, ""Eh, I just don't get the appeal."" It's a beautiful game and it is simply baffling that Americans haven't latched onto it yet. If gyms would put up goals, it'd be just as accessible as basketball in that all you need to play are goals and a ball. It's fun, it's physical, and it requires a lot of the same skills that other sports do. Part of the fun of my league was seeing which athletes from other sports were able to translate their skills into handball. Basketball players had the easiest time with it by far, but interestingly enough the baseball players really seemed to grasp it, too, because of how much throwing is required in baseball.

Anyway, before I go on too many tangents, I guess my point is this: Watch some handball this Olympics. As basketball fans, which all of you are, I can almost guarantee you will enjoy the sport and any publicity handball can get will help it grow in the States. The community tries desperately every year to gain a little traction but without the U.S. even having a horse in the race, it's so hard to do so. Reaching out to basketball fans might be the best way to go, so please watch it, please invite your friends to watch it, and just give the sport a chance. If you can, maybe pick up a ball and try it out somewhere. I promise you'll enjoy it.",24,taffybeast,/r/nba/comments/4x8135/si_lebron_could_be_best_handball_player_in_the/d6dgfut/,d6dgfut,1470964155.0,1470935355.0,"(SI) ""LeBron could be best handball player in the world in 6 months"" says U.S team coach",1478,4x8135
