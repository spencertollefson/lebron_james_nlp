469,"I love this kind of stuff because it becomes so cool when you know the hidden meaning behind things like this. 

Look at 277 on your alpha-numeric phone. 2-7-7. Not obvious at first, but when you start looking at it, it becomes clear that 2-7-7 is actually meant to be A-P-R. 

There are a ton of things these three letters could signify, but then let's think about the thing we know Lebron loves best in this world: small, steady returns on his investments. It just so happens that APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate, or, the amount of interest paid (or charged) for a sum of money. 

Now it's interesting that I said ""charged"" because not only does LeBron love a good interest rate, he is also widely known in NBA circles for taking charges. Rate...charges...APR. Are you following me now? 

Lebron is using basketball to perform one of the most cunning scams on the American people in all it's storied history. Lebron sits at the head of the global banking conglomerate. He pulls levers and strings behind the scenes to manipulate the market. And when the time is right, he will climb into his *American made* starship (using our hard-earned moneys and 401k's), punch in his three digit access code (you guessed it, 2-7-7, wink) and blast into the galaxies to explore crazy new planets whose rich natural resources and primitive humanoid technology will allow for him to start the scam all over again. 

Too big to fail? More like, too Lebron to fail!

Same for JR. Literally, exactly the same. 

Kevin has never been a good defender and also can't score to save his life right now either. 

Rose tries on both ends which is rare for this team but defensively he makes a lot of just pursuit angle mistakes that he shouldn't make. But i'll excuse those since he's actually putting forth effort.

 If you're talking about goat as in who has the best resume, it has to be Kareem. The dude lost like a grand total of two games in high school and college lol, 6 MVP's, 6 rings,  most points, most all star, a lot of mosts. 

If you mean goat as who most transcended the sports with his ability, it's jordan. Scored like no other, aesthetically pleasing game at a time the NBA was exploding, utterly dominated and won on the biggest stages, led the dream team and took the game to another level both on and off the court with marketing, endorsements, off season training methods, etc. 

If you mean goat as in best player to play the game, it's LeBron. 6'8, 260lbs, a one man army Swiss knife. If you're missing offense, he can get you 40pts. If you're point guard is out, he can get you 10ast, if your center is down, he can grab 15rbs and be a serviceable rim protector, ridiculously consistent, ridiculously durable, Can effectively guard 1-4, led a finals series in all statistical categories for both teams and was close two other times, ridiculous basketball IQ that he has developed mostly on his own without the aid of any hall of fame coaches, not an exaggeration to say the man can literally do anything on a basketball court.",954,Miyagisans,/r/nba/comments/7an65p/lebron_youngest_to_29000_and_7th_player_to_reach/dpbcqs0/,dpbcqs0,1509783185.0,1509754385.0,"LeBron youngest to 29,000 and 7th player to reach the mark",847,7an65p

765,"I'm really curious how Jae Crowder and eventually Isaiah fit into that team dynamic.

Both were real leaders here, but with LeBron and Wade there, there might kinda be a small-fish-in-a-big-pond feeling.

Crowder also specifically wouldn't put up with a team not trying to win or give full effort. My favorite story about him is how when he showed up and we were kinda tanking, [he wouldn't put up with it.](http://www.espn.com/blog/boston/celtics/post/_/id/4720754/long-hair-does-care-jae-crowder-energizes-celtics)

>Boston dropped seven of its first eight games after Crowder came over from the Dallas Mavericks as what many deemed a throw-in to the Rajon Rondo blockbuster, and he was seething at all the losing. Then, one day at practice, he completely lost it.

>""I went crazy,"" admitted Crowder. ""I lost my mind here. At practice, I pulled [coach] Brad [Stevens] to the side and asked him, ‘What are we trying to do here? Are we tanking?' And Brad was like, ‘No, no, you don’t have to worry about tanking. I want to win games. We aren’t winning right now, but I want to win games.’""

>**Crowder didn't stop with Stevens. He proceeded to shake down Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge, his teammates, ball boys -- anyone who might be able to tell him exactly what the master plan was for these rebuilding Celtics.**

>""I don’t like losing, man,"" said Crowder. ""I play this game to win. I never in my life played to lose. I don’t know what that feels like. I don’t play like that. I play to win. I felt like that the locker room here was kind of sulking right when I got here. It was sad to be in a professional locker room like that. I didn’t like it. I just wanted to come in each and every day and put my work in and hopefully make guys feed off my energy and take it from there.

And people think he was upset at Celtics fans for cheering for Booker. He wasn't. He was just baffled by how the Phoenix Suns were happy after a loss. The dude *hates* losing.

Observing things like:  who is friends with who, who clearly does not like who, old AAU buddies that will clearly go clubbing together after the game, old college teammates that aren't as friendly to each other as you might expect, etc.  This clip obviously reveals how difficult it is to observe those on TV.  Plus, it's even difficult to see it if you attend a game in-person.  At the few NBA games I've seen live (all in DC), 30 seconds after the game ends the ushers are literally making you leave the seating area and exit the arena.

The same is true in football too, and to a greater degree, even with the physical nature of the game.  In football, for the most part, one team is physically trying to dominate another team--physical pain is intentionally inflicted on every play of the game.

847,"One time, the Shaq/Kobe Lakers were playing in NY and staying at The Plaza hotel, I believe.  I stumbled upon the team bus and realized the team was loading up to head to the stadium.  Met a few guys as they were getting on, including Rick Fox and Mike Madsen.  The rest of the team boards the bus and various team attendants load all their bags.

At least, almost all of the team.  No Shaq or Kobe to be found.  The team sits on the bus for 10 minutes.  10 becomes 20.  Some guys start getting off, sign a few autographs.  Mitch Richmond walks to a newsstand on the corner to buy something.  The crowd gets bigger.  

Probably half an hour after everyone was on the bus, if not more, Kobe finally saunters out of the Plaza, wearing sun glasses and a coat that I'm sure is more expensive than most people's houses. Maybe two minutes later, Shaq comes out, with a huge mink coat looking thing for the 10-foot icy journey from the lobby to the bus.  They board and the bus finally leaves.

I could give them the benefit of the doubt and say that they had an interview that ran long or something of that nature, but I doubt it.  It really seemed like both were holding out to try to be the alpha that is the last person to board the bus, while all the others just had to wait out their pissing contest.

895,"I know people will rapidly make jokes about the title as it looks like it's only that, but the article is cool, so try and give it a read.

Edit - Eh, here is the text for anyone who can't/won't access the link:

> CLEVELAND — Romeo Travis plans to send LeBron James a text Sunday:
> 
> “Watch out for Frank.’’
> 
> Travis, who plays in the French League, is one of James’ best friends, dating to their high-school days in Akron, teammates at St. Vincent-St. Mary.
> 
> Last season, Travis, a power forward, and Knicks’ rookie point guard Frank Ntilikina were teammates for Strasbourg, which made the French League Finals, losing in a decisive Game 5.
> 
> Travis was delighted to hear of Ntilikina’s rousing Garden debut in which he got several ovations coming in and out of the contest Friday against the Nets. Now Ntilikina will face the Cavaliers and LeBron James for the first time Sunday.
> 
> “LeBron’s very knowledgeable about basketball, he knows about Frank and his background,’’ Travis told The Post from France. “I just hope Frank doesn’t have to guard him, though.”
> 
> Travis, who has moved on to play for LeMans, isn’t surprised about Ntilikina’s nine-point, five-assist, defensive-strong outing.
> 
> “He can score but he’s not going to score a lot,’’ Travis said. “He’s just a guy who’s going to make a team better and that’s what he did for us. He may not even get a bunch of assists, but the swing, swing, hockey assist and make the right play.’’
> 
> Injuries had hurt the perception of the 19-year-old Ntilikina, who missed summer league with a knee bruise, four of the five preseason games and two of the first three regular-season games.
> 
> “He had some small injuries here but in France there’s certain injuries you play through but they won’t let you play through in the NBA,’’ Travis said.
> 
> Ntilikina seemed jacked about facing the Cavaliers for the first time.
> 
> “It’s going to be great, but we have to go out there and play like it’s a game like the others,’’ Ntilikina said. “They are so talented. It’s going to be a fun game.’’
> 
> Travis told The Post in late June that Ntilikina asked him about the secret to James’ success.
> 
> “I tell him he’s one of the hardest-working person I’ve ever seen,’’ Travis said in June. “When he has an off-court engagement, he brings a personal trainer with him, meal plan prepared by chefs.
> 
> “He’s like, ‘I have stuff to do off the court, but I’m going to take care of what gets me there.’ ”
> As much as Ntilikina’s nifty lead passes electrified the Garden, Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek was thrilled by his defense. The 6-foot-5, long-armed Ntilikina was a plus-eight in his seven-minute second-quarter stint. The Nets scored 13 points in the period.
> 
> “Going into [camp], we didn’t know if he was going to get killed on pick and rolls,’’ Hornacek said. “But after those first two practices, it was OK, not this kid. He can get around picks. He keeps fighting through them. Not something everyone can do that well.’’
> 
> ---
> 
> After being out of the rotation the first three games, center Willy Hernangomez finally got meaningful time against Brooklyn, logging 13 minutes. During garbage time in Boston, he scored 12 points in 11 minutes, apparently opening Hornacek’s eyes.
> 
> “Everyone knows I can score,’’ Hernangomez said. “I think that game helped me but every day in practice, I showed him I’m really ready to play. I think that’s what they see. Hopefully I play 15, 20 the next game.’’",34,_SotiroD_,/r/nba/comments/79jk47/lebron_has_an_inside_source_on_knicks_rookie/dp2fnwj/,dp2fnwj,1509344272.0,1509315472.0,LeBron has an inside source on Knicks rookie Frank Ntilikina: “Watch out for Frank.’’,176,79jk47
