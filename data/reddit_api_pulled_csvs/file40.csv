9,"There is one scenario I'm really curious about.  So lets say they all agree to take contracts something like Wade - $10 mil, Bosh $13 mil, and Lebron $21 (or whatever the max is).

So that's all down in pencil.

Then the Suns come along and offer Wade the max, on a team that honestly is one super star away from being a real contender IMO.  Especially since the Suns have that training staff that could rejuvenate his knees.

Or if the Bulls lose anthony and go for Bosh with a near-max.

E.G. what if another ""one player away"" contender offers these guys a ton of money to play on a team that, if the Big 3 doesn't exist in Miami, would be the favorite to win a championship with either Bosh or Wade as a larger focal point?

People keep talking about them taking paycuts in order to attract new talent, but there's no way they're taking big cuts just in the *hope* that the Heat can sign someone good. Wade's not leaving all that money on the table just to see it go to a player he doesn't rate: Miami will have solid plans for what to do with it, already vetted and approved by Wade and Bosh. Remember how the Big Three came together in the first place: all of this shit is planned in advance.

Show a bunch of highlights of the Q on a playoff night and the building exploding when he hit game-winning 3 vs. Orlando. http://youtu.be/OAmW2C6hxiM narrated by his buddy Andy Varejao in the room.

I'll then focus on the area. Where he spent the first 25 years of his life. Where he met his beautiful wife Savannah and raised two kids. 

The ill pitch the cap. Cleveland currently sits at $32 million-26.6 under the cap. At that time Varejao will talk about sacrifice and unveil his plans to voluntarily let his option be declined in order to sign a vet minimum to save $8 million in cap space putting us $34 million under. 

Luxury tax is at $70 million leaving ample space to offer him and Melo a max deal estimated at $21.5 million a year. That puts us at $67 million. I then pitch him on Kyrie, Dion, Jabari and his friend Carmelo and on longevity and extending his championship window.

I introduce David Blatt who discusses championships and all of his success at Tel Aviv and in Russia. Blatt outlines his uptempo offense that incorporates a lot of San Antonio's ball movement. Blatt breaks down some X's and O's of how he sees the pieces filling out in his system and shows clips of Kyrie and LeBron's chemistry from the all-star game http://youtu.be/Wlr0KZ3OWQw

Then I look around the room at Dan Gilbert, Big Z, Andy, his high school coach Dru Joyce, Kyrie, David Griffin, and Coach Blatt and we look out the window to see the unveiling of a new downtown banner that simply reads ""Home.""

176,"I feel that I may provide an expert opinion on this as I have, on numerous occasions, wore jordan sandals during pick up games. 

Analysis on jumping: Jumping may be done at full strength in a directly vertical manner. The more distance traveled laterally, the bigger the chance of sandal malfunction. High speed flight not recommended.

Half-court movement: Adjustments to speed need to be made. A player with a high basketball IQ will be able to adapt to a a more deceptive-movement based game. Knowing where to be, and what seams or cuts to move through will help make up for the lack of separation through speed. A slow but beautifully paced euro-step is a beautiful example of what can be achieved in sandals.

Open Court/Fast-break:Cherry picking is still an available bitch move.Under no circumstances may a player exceed 60% of their maximum shoe'd-velocity. Rack your assists up in these situations.

Stability issues: Rolling ankles was no more prevalent in the 12 game study than it had been in the data set based of performances when wearing shoes. Surprisingly enough foot stomps were rare, and generally only a glancing off the side of the foot. 
________________________________________

So in regards to your question.

First I am going to assume Lebron would wear his own Sandal, probably a model similar to the popular Jordan sandals. I will also say that he has had an entire off-season to hone his sandal techniques.

 I would say Lebron would be able to adapt to an old-man playing at the Local gym type game, albeit the most athletic version the world has ever known. Lebron would Average around 18 ppg. This is achievable as he has shown a very nice mid-range jumper over this past season, and because he will be taking at least 12 shots a game. I would say he makes 7 on average a night and goes to the stripe 2-3 times.
    
 His rebounding numbers will probably plummet to around 3-4. Lebron knows going hard at the glass  is a good way to get into a bad situation. Too many super-freak athletes in one small space and Lebron could land on any one of the QE2 sized feet. Tragedy will be avoided as Lebron is smart enough to stay away.

I forsee many an awesome pass from Lebron on the fast break. Without his burst-speed to get away from potential defenders Lebron will have to turn into a creator. Bounce-pass here, 3/4 court oop there, it's all butter. Assists will hover at around 7 per game.

So, yeah. I guess I am done.

Edit TL;DR- Lebron would pop for 18/4/7 a game if he had a summer to practice.",1021,BillBelichicksHoody,/r/nba/comments/28oovf/do_you_think_lebron_james_would_still_be_the_best/ciczxnr/,ciczxnr,1403344080.0,1403315280.0,Do you think LeBron James would still be the best player in the league if he had to wear sandals every game?,2226,28oovf

* He's the best SF in the league and SF is the one position the Clippers are weak at.  No disrespect to Matt Barnes but Lebron is probably equivalent to 20 Matt Barnes

* He would average 30+ in their offense.  He would catch Lobs all day.  They like to run.  No one would be able to stop him on the fast break if you have Blake trailing.  You thought Dwyane Wade and Lebron alleyoops were fun, wait til you see him catching lobs from CP3 or having back and forths with BG.

* Doc Rivers.  One of the best coaches in the league, that Lebron loves.

* Ballmer.  This guy is crazy loaded and shows he's willing to spend whatever it takes to build a contender.

* Plenty of weapons.  It honestly feels like every single player on the Clippers can hit an open shot, they're probably the closest thing to San Antonio.  Also since they have a good bench, he can take plenty of rest and not worry about having to come in when he's not ready.

* legacy.  Imagine the king taking the laughing stock of the NBA for decades to a championship.  He'd be more than a champion, he'd be a legend.

* LA.  you guys love to talk crap about Los Angeles, but it really is an awesome place to live because of how big and diverse it is.  There are districts to fit any niche or ethnic group.  Korea Town, Little Tokyo, China town, East LA, Compton, Santa Monica, Long Beach, Inglewood, Bloods, Crips, Hollywood.  Imagine the movie offers and endorsements he'd get.

Howard turns 29 in December, Harden turns 25 in August. The Rockets core is fairly young so advertising can be done without Howard. Although McHale hasn't proved himself to be a good coach and the West isn't an easy task to come out from. Kobe and his Lakers will seemingly be ready, Mavs are going to be poised, Trailblazers are on the rise, as are the Warriors and Suns. Spurs will be the Spurs, Clippers and Thunder have the talent to be competing, Grizzlies look like a contender if they keep their core in tact, the Pelicans will be a brute force.

Wade takes less money but doesn't go anywhere. We don't need another star player we need a new scheme built around Bosh and Bron and get about 12 mil worth of quality role players and a decent PG.

We need to go after Shawn Marion to replace Battier. Oden will never be a huge piece but he will be back and can be a surge off the bench in limited minutes(look at his per 48). Beasley gets another offseason to learn the schemes. Other than that we gotta trust in Riley.

342,"This isn't the time for comparing stats and nitpicky analyses.  It's one thing to use stats during the regular season or over entire careers when the sample size is large enough.  But there is no metric anywhere that can give us a definitive answer of who is outpalying who in a best-of-7 series.  
 
The problem with the Heat is abundantly clear once you actually watch a damn game:  The heat are tired. They play a kind of hero ball in which they rely on big plays in clutch moments.  Let's be real, if it weren't for Ray's corner 3, Spurs would have won last year.  The heat are tired for simple reasons:

* Wade's knees can't physically hold up much longer

* Lebron is one year older, he is bigger than a dominant player like Jordan so his size makes it harder on his joints when he takes a spill, making his longevity shorter than a smaller player of comparable skill

* Bosh has been conditioned so hard as a role player that he can't suddenly shift to a superstar again now that his team is down and out and needs him to play big on both ends of the floor

* Ray Allen should be in a senior center by now.  The guy is a freak, and one of my  favorite players, but he is too damn old

* The Spurs simply counter the heat so well.  They have 3 forwards 6'9""+ (Splitter, Duncan, Diaw).  Each are excellent passers and any combination of them can be on the floor at once.  This allows San Antonio to counter a small Miami Lineup with Bosh even on the Perimeter.  The solid passing really makes Miami run.

* Kawhi Leonard

You can try to quantify who had a better series or talk about how Wade sucks because, well, game 4.  But the reality is, Wade did his normal thing, the shots just didnt fall. Kawhi and Danny Green defending your stars makes running a half court offense tremendously tiring in and of itself.  If your entire team is tired, old, and injured, that certainly doesn't help.  
 
 
It's unfortunate that we may never get to see a player as dominant as Michael Jordan, but it's alright, because we're about to witness the culmination of the next best winner of all time, Tim Duncan.  And he deserves it.  After defeating the Cavaliers in 2007(edit), Tim Duncan said to Lebron: ""Don't worry this will be your league soon.""

431,"Just for fun... 

This summer the Lakers have 38M in cap commitments (that's including a 3M cap hold for the #7 pick) meaning we will have 25M in cap space; enough to offer 12.5M to Melo and LeBron, each. Clearly that won't cut it.

Well what if we trade the #7 pick to either NYK or MIA (presumptively, they would like something in return for their fleeing superstars) and waive the team option on Kendall Marshall (~1Mil). That would give us 29M in cap space or enough to offer Melo/Bron ~14.5M each. Still not gonna cut it. 

But what if we use the stretch provision to waive Nash, spreading his 9M out across 3 years and giving us an extra 6M in room this summer; giving us 35M in cap space or enough pay Bron/Melo 17.5M each. 

Or maybe we convince Nash to retire? He's said he's basically only in it for the paychecks and clearly has to realize his body is falling apart; we can keep him on the payroll in some sort of advisory capacity.  Well, that would open up enough cap space to Max Melo AND Bron; Kobe's 23.5M and all.

LeBron James has absolutely nothing to prove to anyone. Anyone criticizing his ""mental toughness"" or ""clutch-ness"" or ""heart"" is either watching too much Skip Bayless on ESPN first take, or is just looking for attention.

452,"The reason he is so criticized is because of the hype. Since he was in high school people have been calling him the next Jordan. When he played for years on a horrid team and couldn't win a ring by himself, the trolls came out of the woodworks to point and laugh. Honestly, most of the hate has gone away as far as his skill level goes. People still give him shit for being a sellout or whatever, but you can't argue with 4 finals trips in a row.

I believe he is going to have more rings than Jordan when its all said and done. He is just too good. Him taking the Cavs to the finals might be the most impressive feat in basketball history. Jordan or Kobe never had a team even close to as bad as the cavs were, and neither of them won without potential hall of famers on their team.

455,"It's the combination of a lot of things. 

First, it's the hype. He was touted as the next big thing when he was in high school. He wanted to skip his senior year to enter the NBA. His HS games were shown on TV. He was called ""The Chosen One"" and has that tattooed on himself. When somebody is hyped up to that degree, a lot of people will root for him to fail. 

Second, he's had a few repeat playoff battles. He beat the Wizards 3 straight times. Played KG/Pierce 4 times? Beat the Bulls twice. Beat the Pacers 3 times. All of these fan bases do or at one point have had a lot of animosity towards LeBron. 

Third, The Decision. The way he went about switching teams left a sour taste in a lot of people's mouths. Also, people dislike the whole superteam thing. 

Fourth, Kobe and MJ fans make up a large portion of LeBron haters. Although they probably wont' admit it's the reason they hate LeBron, Kobe and Michael Jordan fans are threatened by LeBron. LeBron is a better player than Kobe was even in his prime. Kobe fans will hold on to the fact that Kobe has more rings, and desperately hope that it remains that way. Michael Jordan fans, are probably less threatened, but hate that LeBron gets compared to Jordan and will always try to diminish LeBron. 


Fifth, some people are just morons. They think LeBron isn't a killer, because he's willing to pass on the final possession. They think he has no killer instinct because he makes the right basketball play instead of forcing a bad shot. He had one uncharacteristically bad season during clutch time (2011) and they think he's missing a ""clutch gene"". They shit on him for not shaking hands after the Orlando series, but ignore the fact that their own players have all done the same (Kobe, KG, Pierce, Rondo). 

Finally, he's the best player in the league. Naturally, some people will always want him to fail. 


While general opinion on LeBron has become much more favorable since 2011, there's always gonna be a pretty large legion of LeBron haters. Just ignore them and appreciate that we get to witness greatness.",21,IL05,/r/nba/comments/27ojo5/why_is_lebron_the_most_criticized_pro/ci2u7zf/,ci2u7zf,1402331811.0,1402303011.0,Why is LeBron the most criticized Pro?,60,27ojo5

I think a solid 20/11 with even-lower-than usual (sub-13% ish) turnover rate, even-higher-than-usual (60%-ish TS) efficiency would do it. That'd result in something like 125+ ORtg, almost 0.300 WS/48, and 30-ish PER, probably; an all-time great season for a PG.

If a season like that was paired with team success on the order of 60 wins, I certainly think CP3 would be the favorite, at least if LeBron and Durant had comparable seasons to '14.

To be honest, if CP3 put up something ridiculous like 25/14 without drastically increasing his minutes to 40+ (not going to happen) or dramatically changing his offensive efficiency (in terms of turnover/shooting efficiency) or the Clippers' pace suddenly becoming much, much faster, that would be by FAR the greatest regular season of all time, and would likely result in ridiculous numbers like 35+ PER and .350 WS/48.

Can't say I'm fully rooting for him, I'm young, and the first finals I watched was the Spurs putting on a clinic on the Cavaliers, which honestly made me fall in love with that Spurs franchise, and that love follows to this day.

 I'm just thankful to the guy for that Pistons series (my high point in basketball for more than a few reasons) and for giving the fans out here in Ohio a great run. 

WE WENT TO THE FINALS! I never expected that kind of success. I'm young, but not too young to remember those good indians teams, the good browns team, and the fading of the old Cavs. We go through a lot up here, as you all know.

So, I don't care where he returns, I just want the guy to keep playing the most impressive ball I've been blessed to see in person.

I just wish our organizations would get their acts together. 

If I was in his shoes, I'd be focusing on my current teammates, and the finals. The off-season will bring what it does. I'd be personally excited if he did come here, but to me, I'm happy enough seeing the guy just lace his shoes and throw on the uni that makes him happy.

>**Q. First, the obvious. How are you feeling?** 
LeBRON JAMES: I'm feeling better than I did when I came off the floor. So, doing better.

>**Q. You were going to try to give it a go?** 
LeBRON JAMES: I was going to try to give it a go and Spo said no. It sucks at this point in time in the season. You know, after I made that layup we was down two and, you know, as well as they played we still had a chance. You know, after I came out of the game, they kinda took off. And it was frustrating sitting out and not be able to help our team.

>**Q. Is it just frustration? Is it anger?** 
LeBRON JAMES: Yeah, it's both. I mean, it's frustration and anger, but at the same time it's something that you try to prevent, you try to control. I mean, I got all the fluids I need to get, I do my normal routine I've done and it was inevitable for me tonight, throughout the conditions, you know, out there on the floor. I lost all the fluids that I was putting in in the last couple of days out there on the floor.
It sucks not being out there for your team, especially at this point in the season.

>**Q. You tried to move, just saw the legs buckle on the baseline, how much pain were you in?** 
LeBRON JAMES: The best option for me to do was not to move. I tried and any little step or nudge, it would get worse. It would lock up worse and my muscles spasmed 10 out of 10. Best thing for me to do was just not to move, and, you know, it was frustrating.

>**Q. Was it just the left leg or was there more?** 
LeBRON JAMES: Well, no, it was the whole left leg, damn near the whole left side. I was losing a lot throughout the game. It was extremely hot in the building, you know, both teams, fans, everybody could feel it. I was the one that had to take the shot.

>**Q. What did you try and do at halftime? Did you have any idea how much fluid you tried to get in you?** 
LeBRON JAMES: Drank a lot at halftime, even changed my uniform, just tried to get the sweat up off of you. Our training staff tried to do the best they could by giving us ice bags and cold towels on timeouts, keep us dry.
It was an unusual circumstance, I never played in a building like that, it's been a while, like high school game or CYO and everybody is sitting on top and you feel good being in a building like that.
But, you know, at the end of the day, it's no discredit for what they did. They played extremely well. They moved the ball extremely well. I think they had 30 assists. You know, even from the turnovers both teams were committing, uncharacteristic of both teams, they played extremely well.

>**Q. You have nearly three full days now before you have to play again, how thankful are you that you have the extra day in between?** 
LeBRON JAMES: I need it, I need it, I need it. We're going to start tonight, continue to get the fluids in me and get me ready for Sunday. Thankful for the fact that I can get on it tonight, and put myself in a position where I can be out there for my team for the long haul. And sitting on the sideline, you know, if I'm not in foul trouble, is not good for us and not good for me.

It was crazy, intense pain. I could barely walk.

I got the ball from the end bounds and started dribbling up the court. I was fighting through the pain.


I passed the ball. My teammate pump faked, then passed me the ball. I pump faked quick, dribbled towards the rim, took a shot.


Air ball.


I fell to the floor; grasping my hamstring. I tried to stand up, but couldn't. I was helped off the floor.

Comments like ""Lebron is such a fag"" would get like 30 upvotes in gamethreads, and it only got worse in any Bulls game thread. Bulls fans were triple salty because not only did Lebron go to the Heat when they wanted him, but Wade stayed on the Heat when they wanted him.

Beverly has a big problem with being *too aggressive* most of the time and any smart player takes full advantage of that.  Bev over commits himself when defending and plays up into the body of guys when he should be laying off at times.  His tenacity on D can be exploited by experienced vets and his off ball defense could improve.  He does a good job making up for his lack of size but he's not an All Defense player to me, certainly not above a guy like Mike Conley.

I would've much rather seen Tony Allen get some love since these All NBA teams aren't strictly a PG, SG etc format.  Lebron's selection was a reputation pick too.

688,"The context is very different. When Lebron was in high school he already had massive attention. I remember the talk was that he was going to be Michael Jordan but better because he was taller and had a bigger frame. He came into the league straight from high school as the #1 pick and took the number 23. Again, this brought more attention to the comparisons with MJ and people took it as a sign that Lebron thought he was the next MJ, or that he was better than MJ. The media really ran with this story and they knew they could always fall back on it whenever they needed a story. There were always the comparisons with Kobe as well since they both came out of high school. 

Then Lebron faced criticism when Miami won in 2006. Wade was from the same draft as Lebron, but Wade was the first to get a championship. This gave plenty of fuel for the media. The next season after he made it to the finals and got swept. While people loved to laugh at him being swept, the general consensus was that he would lead his team to winning the next year.

This would continue over the next few years. It was always ""Lebron failed because of x reason but next year he can do it"". The real criticism came during the MVP years at Cleveland where his team would have amazing seasons but would fail to win in the playoffs. Here is where the whole ""Lebron isn't clutch"" crap became the big story. 

Now KD on the other hand has had far less attention. When he came in to the league he didn't have #23 and he wasn't expected to be the GOAT. He was just expected to be a future star and potential winner when he hits his prime. But there was far more attention given to the whole Supersonics moving to Oklahoma issue. When his team made it to the finals they were beaten by the Miami Heat big 3 who everyone had already expected to win. Then the year afterwards, Westbrook was injured. No one from KD's draft have had anywhere close to his success yet so he doesn't have that hanging over him either. 

This year though the criticism is coming for KD. It will be no where near as much as Lebron faces, but you already see here people saying Westbrook was the better player and KD was a shadow. There's also already been the ""Mr Unreliable"" articles. Personally though I think it is stupid to focus on this kind of criticism. The game of basketball is incredibly complicated and to follow the trend of criticising aspects of the game based on knee jerk reactions or oversimplying is just going to lead to unnecessary stress. The mass media is always going to run stories that rely on generalities instead of in depth analysis.

752,"My thoughts. Not that it matters much, but I am a youth league ref and have been scorekeeping rec league games for the past 4 years. I'm using the [grading scale from this article](http://www.82games.com/lakerskingsgame6.htm)

Foul 1: It looks like he may have been tripped by Bosh, but I can't really tell from this angle. Definitely not a foul on LeBron. From Malloy's angle, he sees James shuffle towards George and George trips at the same time. He doesn't have a great angle and it is reasonable that he made that call, though it is wrong. **Verdict: Dubious**

Foul 2: Very little contact and Malloy has a good angle. This is a bad call. **Verdict: Very Dubious**

Foul 3: George does not get in position, but James lowers his shoulder. He lowers his shoulder in preparation for contact and it is very obvious that he does so. George got set originally, but dragged his left foot to lean into contact so it was a block. Difficult call to make in real time and is 50/50 in my opinion **Verdict: Maybe**

Foul 4: First off, it has been going around that Ed Malloy called all of the fouls, but this is false. Tom Washington called this one. Make of that what you will. As for the foul, very soft call, but he does make contact with the Roy's arm. By the book that is a foul, though it is usually not called. **Verdict: Maybe**

Foul 5: Should have been a no call both ways. There was some contact by Stephenson that could have potentially been called a foul and some contact by James that could have been called a foul, though both players did not do enough to warrant a foul in my opinion. **Verdict: Dubious**

Conclusions: I have never been one to call a fix, and I still don't think this game was fixed, despite the very questionable officiating on James. However, after looking over the LeBron fouls, this game has come closer to convincing me that there could be game-fixing then anything in the '06 finals or '02 Western Conference Finals. There were no fouls called on LeBron that were more than 50-50 and of the 5 fouls Ed Malloy called 4. At least 3 of them were definite wrong calls in my opinion. Make of the game what you will, but I still believe that making the right call can be very difficult at times and refs are subject to calling bad games without having intentionally trying to alter the outcome. The Heat definitely got screwed tonight regardless if it was intentional or otherwise.

Even in his rookie season he had just past their primes Tiny Archibald, Dave Cowens, and Cedric Maxwell in his prime.  Lebron had Ricky Davis his rookie year.  Bird's mid-80's Celtics were stacked from an all-timer perspective.  Much more so than the Miami Heat.  I'll take DJ, McHale, Parrish, and Bill Walton off the bench over Wade, Bosh, and a bunch of complimentary players.  

What would Lebron have done on a team as stacked as the Celtic's?  How would Bird have done with Ricky Davis and Boozer as your wingmen?

EDIT:  And even though they compare statistically and played the same position, they were still pretty dissimilar players.  Lebron plays (usually) great man-D while Bird roved around.

793,"They are actually very close percentage wise and average wise.  Shooting percentages are 1% off, 3pt % is only a couple percent apart.  

Bird has more rebounds and a higher FT% but Lebron averages nearly 4 points more per game for his career so far.  Lebron is one year away from passing Bird in longevity and already has 2000+ more career points.  

Lebron is less than 100 away from Bird in blocks and steals and has already surpassed him in assists.  

In short, projecting into the future, Lebron is already producing at Birds level career stat wise, and he's played 2 less years than Bird.  Barring massive career ending injury early next year, he will easily surpass Bird in every category within 2 years while likely matching Birds efficiency or even getting better.  

IMO, Lebron is definitely better than Bird.  By the time he reaches Birds years in the league, he will have smashed Birds stats while scoring way more.

Chris Paul-Best PG in League (general consensus) (Has been top 5 MVP voting in many recent years and many considered his 2008 MVP robbed from him via Kobe)

Jamal Crawford (A threat to put up 30 points in any game, crunch time scoring, and has averaged close to 20ppg during his prime). He is also 2x Six Man of the Year

Matt Barnes (Above average defender average offensively)

Blake Griffin (Carried the team in Paul's absence, arguably best PF in league 3rd in MVP Voting)

Deandre Jordan (Young Raw Defensive Center who can defend as well as any Center in the league today. Lead the League in Rebounds and I think top 5 in FG% and Blocks a few years in the league)

Glen Davis (Actually carried Orlando and few years and while he isn't a great player in general he's fantastic to have as a 8th or 9th man)

Darren Collison (A great backup PG that most teams would wish to have a player like Collison as their backup PG)

JJ reddick (Solid Shooting Guard who can make high percentage of FT and make open 3 pointers with a very high percentage)

Danny Granger (washed up All-star who could potentially heal up maybe in recent years?)

Doc Rivers (Coaching may not apply to a team's talent but its worth noting that Doc is a top 5 coach in the league and is better than Spoelstra

I'm not saying they're more talented then the Heat but if you across the team's 12 man roster, you could make the case that the Clippers all around are more talented than the Heat, this season.

LeBron left Cleveland and left an owner who only managed to surround LeBron with Mo Williams. He also left an owner who guaranteed the Cavs would win a title before LeBron did with the Heat. I can't imagine the relationship between Gilbert and LeBron being great.

Also, LeBron was brought into a situation constructed by a guy who is a proven winner at the many jobs he has had in Pat Riley. Why would LeBron leave a team run by a pretty smart guy and leave the guy who gave him the environment to win titles? So he can go back to an unproven organization that already failed with LeBron before?

That's my opinion on this. And after all of this, I still kind of wouldn't be surprised to see LeBron go back to Cleveland this summer (though I would bet that it won't happen).",201,staps94,/r/nba/comments/265qqj/barkley_lebron_should_join_cavs/chnws7t/,chnws7t,1400741568.0,1400712768.0,Barkley: Lebron should join Cavs,243,265qqj

911,"I have this argument with my friends all the time.  At the end of the day, Cleveland is only attractive to Lebron because he is from Ohio.  There are other places that do certain things better than Miami that might be tempting to him, but Cleveland is not one of them.  If he wanted to go to a bigger market, the Lakers or Knicks are an option.  If he wanted to play with a team that has a good supporting cast or coach he could play for the Spurs or the Bulls, but the Cavs have shown they can't put together a good team even with good lottery picks.  As long as Pat Riley continues to make good decisions and doesn't let the team stagnate with aging players on large contracts, why would he give up a couple years getting used to a new team, coach, and system before he'd get another shot at a ring?

968,"Yes.

This is no knock on KD but it will be hard to sway the opinion of the more ""educated"" basketball fan that he is the better player even in the next few years. Certainly we can look at the stats and eye test and see that KD has made significant strides in his other areas of the game (passing, defence, etc.), however Lebron was almost born into all those skills. All those other area's of the game are basically second nature to him.

The scary part is, Durant is rounding out his all around game to become closer to LBJ's impact on the court certainly, but I almost think that Lebron has made more strides in his offensive repertoire to actually rival Durant's biggest strength (scoring).

All in all, the best part of these two is that they are seemingly making each other better player's than they would be otherwise and it is awesome as an NBA fan.",102,soccer_star005,/r/nba/comments/25h3uw/even_with_kd_taking_home_the_mvp_this_year_is/chh3ibs/,chh3ibs,1400039504.0,1400010704.0,"Even with KD taking home the MVP this year, is Lebron still widely considered the best basketball player on the planet?",156,25h3uw
