Cavs, Knicks, Pacers and Pistons fans hated him the most, but not because of his personality, but because he would be their teams' worst nightmare. He was respected as the GOAT, but still hated for being the GOAT.

With Lebron, it's entirely different, especially with social media now. There was the cockiness, the self-proclaimed king at age 18, inability to win early in his career (he was on some bad teams), The Decision (which ultimately was for a good cause), Pre-Heat championship ceremony, and playing the villain on the Heat. But there's also a lot of the same hate that Jordan got that Lebron gets too. Everyone now accepts how dominant he is, and most of the hate comes from fans wanting him to lose because he's so dominant.

97,"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.

People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.

The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.

Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.

And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.

Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.
So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.

You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.

This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.

So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like ~~LeBron James~~ The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?

Passing is the next most important and I'd say that's a tie as both guys have great vision. Lebron can score too, but when you close the lane on him and force him to shoot from distance, he gets tentative - Boris Diaw can attest. With Bird I wouldn't have that problem. That's why I'll pick him. I take skill over talent. Bird's three point shooting is overstated: the three point thing back then was just a gimmick, it's just been added during Larry's prime.

More so than those guys, Lebron's multifaceted game is hampered in a 1v1 comparison. His greatness lies in his ability to control a game outside of sheer scoring (which he is obviously capable of). From a 1v1 perspective, his handle is average and his ""go-to"" move involves running through a guy and scoring a layup through overwhelming strength. His postgame is also lacking.

FWIW, prime Kobe would be the best comparison to MJ 1v1. I actually give Kobe the slight edge. He wouldn't give a fuck about MJ's mental toughness and I think he has better footwork/a better post game than Jordan (assuming we are talking about healthy prime Kobe).

3) Bird has always been a better shooter than LeBron and is a top five shooter of all-time. His game also relied way less on athleticism than LeBron, thus relating back to the first point even more.

That said, and while I don't expect everyone to understand, or to agree with me; LeBron is my Michael Jordan.

He came into the league at a time when ISO ball and dominant scorers were what teams clamored for. Guys like AI, Kobe, VC, T-Mac, Antoine Walker, Mitch Richmond and so many others dominated by being mainly scorers. LeBron  turned basketball analytics on its head, and displayed a level of aptitude and ability that was rarely seen in a player. I mean now, we have hybrid players like PG13, Blake, KD, Lance, Beal who can do it all, and combo guards like Russ, Rose, Wall,  among others who value efficiency and all aroundedness above scoring.

He was and is a team first player, and relished on getting his guys going before wondering about himself. He's taken flak for not taking the last shot and instead making the correct basketball play, and in his interviews, he's always stuck with his decision to make said play. It's amazing Even when you look back at interviews of him in his teens, like seriously, 15 to 17 years old, he's displayed a level on humbleness that is so rare; especially someone who was professed as the next great thing *in high school*.

I've followed him through his whole career, and I am so beyond proud of how he's handled himself(decision withstanding) and what's he's accomplished. That his career is winding down makes me kinda sad because I've basically grown with LeBron.

I'm serious when I say the game will miss him when he's gone.

318,"I have so many conflicted thoughts on this series. First, it's painful because I knew this was the Big Three's last serious run. What's more, the team was banged up as hell and missing several key role players due to injury. With that being said, this was my favorite Celtics team. It's also why I disagree with anyone who says only the champions had a successful year. To me, I'm more proud of this team than any other sports team I ever watched. I still smile like a weirdo when I think of [Pierce hitting that clutch three over LeBron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_uulujs-MM) in game five. I remember shouting, ""Paul Pierce brought his talent to South Beach!""

On the other side of the equation, this series made me a believer in LeBron, and subsequently, a huge fan of his. I followed him since his first game in the league, but grew to naturally dislike him as he posed a threat to the Celtics. I was so hyped for the Celtics to finish the series in game six at Boston, only for LeBron to enter a cheat code and put on a performance like I've never seen before. [He made like a dozen straight shots in the first half](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VzBeOrdAg), destroying the Big Three's final Finals run. I was heartbroken, but knew I witnessed greatness.

365,"EDIT: instead of breaking it up into paragraphs, I attempted the full scale thing and did my best at translating this all and formatting it without changing any of Gilbert's points: 

> KINGJAMES: this person comes around once in a blue moon. This is a man who is so physically gifted he could walk into any sport and be a HOF'ER off his natural and God given ability. The last person who was this gifted in sports might have been Bo Jackson. 

> Let's take away every stat and start from scratch. His natural gifts: 6-8, 275 pounds, 44 inch vert, once at top speed can't be stopped. He also has vision like Magic Johnson and is a natural lefty who plays basketball as a righty. Him stepping on an NBA floor with no effort = stats at 25/6/7. 

> Now his WEAKNESSES that he had to work on to be the G.O.A.T: James is more like a train then a cheetah in movement; his first 2 steps aren't very powerful so this hurt him on iso's and the ability to blow past players from a standstill position. This hints at why he's at the point; he needs to be moving at all times so when he decides to attack, he's already in full motion. 

> Notice that he doesn't change direction well because he doesn't bend much. He plays straight up and down, like Jason Kidd did, which limits him from crossovers and spinning.

> James isn't a number one option, and yes (I didn't stutter) he lacks selfishness so he will always need a go-to-guy like Wade was or Kyrie now. 

> He lacks what jordan and kobe were, great 1-on-1 players. He needs a pure scorer beside him so he can carry the TEAM load. He gets bashed a lot by media because he doesn't take over like MJ or Kobe, but Lebron is Magic with Jordan-like athleticism, so he walks into stats without trying and when forced, he will give you 41/12/8. 

> The finals was the first time in his career he was physically pushed to the limit because he had no one to defer to. When players like Magic, Barkley and analysts bash him I cringe. Like, you people have no idea what he could do if he had one season, just one selfish season, like Kobe did in 2005-06, he would average 40+/11/9, and no one could do shit about it. 

> It's sad the world won't get to see who I'm talking about because his legacy is built on winning. If you doubt what I'm saying: look at every game he was pissed off and was challenged.

I will say that Hibachi's anlysis about LeBron having a pissed-off mode is 100% true though.

I agree with his first point but his second point is a discussion for sure. A lot of people consider Jordan as GOAT because he takes over and dominates games by his scoring like no other (other than the obvious six rings). What he's saying is that if LeBron had 'tapped into his ability' and be a bit more selfish throughout his career, who knows? He could've dominated games offensively like Jordan and thus making his case for GOAT easier.

But on the flip side, LeBron didn't have a reliable jumper for most of his career. And taking it to the rim every offensive possession takes a toll on the body. Maybe that's also why he looked for his teammates more.",118,noahsbun,/r/nba/comments/3f4f4x/gilbert_arenas_breaks_down_lebron_james_and/ctl7tuz/,ctl7tuz,1438260807.0,1438232007.0,Gilbert Arenas breaks down Lebron James and raises some interesting points (read the caption).,2123,3f4f4x

> ""The irony to me is that LeBron is not Michael. LeBron is actually Scottie,"" former Bull and current television analyst Steve Kerr said Monday on ""The Waddle &amp; Silvy Show"" on ESPN 1000. ""He's so similar to Scottie in that defensively he was just a monster, could guard anybody, really more of a point forward than scoring guard. Scottie always loved to distribute the ball. That's really where LeBron's preference is.

> ""Phil Jackson used to call Scottie a 'sometimes shooter.' Sometimes they would go in, sometimes they wouldn't. That's how it is with LeBron. He's a great talent and a great player but you can see his flaws as a basketball player. He doesn't have an offensive game that he can rely on: no low-post game, no mid-range jump shot so when the game really gets tough he has a hard time finding easy baskets and getting himself going. That's what Michael did in his sleep so that's why the comparison is wrong.""

854,"Anyone who says Windhorst is credible is kidding themselves. The guy has been wrong about things Cavs dating back to before Lebron came back, so if you believe that guy then there is absolutely no changing your mind.

As for Stein, he was questioning Blatt back in December. Shortly after that the Cavs closed the season by being the best team in Basketball from January after the trades and Lebron's hiatus to the playoffs. Than they lost two games all the way to the Finals. Now Stein has access, and he takes one event, and uses it to continue to drive his narrative. He has been waiting all season for this. Why can't Marc Stein actually show more than just this one example in the heat of battle that Lebron doesn't respect Blatt. Why does he ignore all of the positive things Lebron and Blatt have said? Because it doesn't fit his narrative. I'm done defending this. Believe Blatt has no credibility with the team all you want, I just look forward to next season with a hopefully healthy roster and see what happens then.",41,debtsetradio,/r/nba/comments/3ake73/the_entire_blatt_vs_lebron_fiasco_is_a/csdg940/,csdg940,1434882364.0,1434853564.0,The entire Blatt vs. Lebron fiasco is a media-fabricated illusion that undermines the intelligence of the average fan,47,3ake73
855,"Everyone should go back and listen to [this](http://espn.go.com/espnradio/grantland/player?id=12594321) podcast.  I don't love Windhorst, but these sorts of reports have been bubbling the entire season if you've been paying attention.  These aren't anonymous ""sources,"" these are basketball people who are watching games and talking about what they've seen.  Watching LeBron talk to Ty Lue and ignore Blatt. Watching LeBron call plays.  Watching LeBron do the opposite of what Blatt says in the huddle.  Windhorst talked about seeing this stuff throughout the season, Simmons talked about how you could see some of it on TV even, and Steiny-Mo talked in his article about how he saw these things in the finals.  Now of course LeBron is saying nice things in public, it would be PR suicide to kill his coach or say that he makes the final call on what plays they run.  LeBron might be better at PR than any person on the planet at this point, no one is as scrutinized as he is.

This whole situation reminds me a lot of the Thibs talk, which everyone tried to say was fine because neither side would publicly take shots at the other.  Then it turned out to be a dumpster fire.  Zach Lowe's podcast discussed after the fact it was funny that people were convinced Thibs would be back because of the public comments, when everyone in the know knew there was no chance of that happening.

LeBron had a rookie NBA coach that he didn't completely trust (rightly so) and he took the reigns all season.  Kevin Love played out of position and (surprise) wasn't happy all season about his usage.  LeBron heavily leaned on a veteran assistant that he trusted and respected (Tyron Lue).

904,"The story r/nba is buying into at the moment is pretty odd.  As I understand it the narrative is now that Lebron player-coached the team and ignored Blatt due to lack of respect, but his team had a staggering amount of success the latter half of the season into the post-season. Particularly given Love and Kyrie's injuries.  Then Lebron the player-coach took the clearly best team in the NBA to a 6 game series when most analysts were predicting a 4-5 game series post Kyrie's injury while, if somewhat inefficient on shooting, still put up the best Finals performance since Shaq/Jordan.

Simultaneously we're now crediting Blatt, who the Stein article is saying was largely ignored with respect to coaching decisions, for the success the Cavs had in the latter half of the season and postseason?  But Lebron, and not Blatt, is responsible for the fact that they didn't win a championship?

Like, if Lebron respected Blatt more he would have taken the team he had to the promised land of a championship given the injuries the Cavs had in the postseason?  Does anybody actually believe this?

Given this it's hard to see the Stein article and people's response as anything other than character assassination.  I mean, I buy that Lebron is hard to coach and probably did overrule Blatt on stuff, but unless people really believe that there would have been a fundamental difference in outcome had Lebron respected/deferred to Blatt, this all just seems like a circlejerk of Lebron hate.",51,shlevon,/r/nba/comments/3abqrr/david_griffin_on_stories_about_lebronblatt/csbcg89/,csbcg89,1434702239.0,1434673439.0,"[David Griffin] On stories about LeBron-Blatt relationship as told by media 'Relative to the tone of the stories, I really don't care.

999,"I agree with the large German. 

I keep an open mind on the FMVP debate in that losing should not outright disqualify you from the award, but that it sure as hell puts you in a massive hole to climb out of. That is the reason why it never happens and I think that's not unreasonable because the finals are still about winning.  I will, however, not draw such a hard line in the sand to say that it should never happen. If a losing player averages 42/13/12 on 50/40/85 in a series that's pushed to 7 games, I can see the argument provided the winning team doesn't have anyone putting up anything close to that line. I'll vote for a 30/8/8 winner on similar %'s.

To me, a loser has to be **way better** in every way than a winning candidate, without excuse or qualifiers. That includes things like ""well he's only shooting poorly because he has to do everything for his team"". That is true, but it still means he's shooting poorly. It's well below league average. Let that sink in. 

For all the valid reasons as to why it's sub 40, it's still sub 40! In my eyes, it renders his (very, very impressive) performance not quite enough to compensate for losing the big dance.
