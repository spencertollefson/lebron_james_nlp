But no one should be shocked at this. LeBron was publicly supporting Clinton all the way to the end and the NBA is a majority black league (both in number and culturally). It's not surprising that even white people (Pop, Van Gundy, Kerr) would be liberals considering the environment they're surrounded by.

You're much more likely to find Trump supporters in baseball and the NFL where a lot of people are brought up around good ol'boys. I'd be curious about the NHL though; lot of Canadians and Scandinavians in that league.
