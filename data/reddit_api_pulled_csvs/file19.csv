113,"> According to sources, James walked out of the practice facility Tuesday, shaking his head and loudly wondering why Griffin “wouldn’t be able to get a new contract.” James appeared to be speaking to no one in particular, but wanted to send a message — the Cavaliers superstar wants Griffin to return.

 Sources say he was later seen repeatedly sighing until someone asked what was wrong. ",442,Rakatok,/r/nba/comments/69h13a/bohlin_lebron_frustrated_griffin_doesnt_have_a/dh6i5p8/,dh6i5p8,1494044210.0,1494015410.0,[Bohlin]- Lebron frustrated Griffin doesn't have a new deal.,196,69h13a

>n response to the people hyped in this thread, has he really done anything magical though?
not trying to down on him but does taking advantage of a knicks front office really give him notches here. dell demps did the same thing to kings and I wouldn't call their franchise a success story under him so far.
i fully understand and have no problem if he's one of Lebron's guys and it's cool if he's looking out for him but as a GM is he really above average. just seems like everything under his reign can be retraced to Lebron having input over it.


turned Dion Waiters and a his own draft pick into Mozzy,JR, Shumpert. Turned Dunleavy and Mo's corpse into Korver. Turned a pick and Andy's albatross contract into Frye. 

Had foresight to make small moves upon small moves to create TPE's out of basically nothing. Had foresight to grab Branden Heywood's contract because it was a 10 million dollar non-guaranteed contract that was a HUGE trade asset. 

I know it's fun to say LBJ is the ""LeGM"" here, but if you really took the time to dig in and pay attention you'd see that Griffin has made some terrific moves that he's never going to get the credit for, because of the ""LeGM"" misnomer.

147,"I mean honestly, Serge should have went after the ball the second LeBron started spinning it. I'm the biggest LeBron fan there is, I will defend him in nearly anything he does, and spinning the ball last night was disrespectful (even though I loved it).

But as a defender, if someone does that, go after them. The ball is completely undefended. Ibaka let him be disrespectful and let him score. As someone who plays basketball, I would never let that happen. If I see someone I'm guarding letting the basketball​ be that vulnerable, I'm coming after it, and if they let it be that vulnerable while doing something to taunt me, I'm coming after it HARD. 

Look, we all know Serge can't stop LeBron, but he shouldn't let him walk over him like that and let him show off in front of him. If I'm Serge, I'm swiping hard, I'm fouling LeBron, I'm letting him know ""you're​ better than me, but im not gonna let you blatantly disrespect me"". 

Chauncey is right, go after him. Man up. This is the playoffs. You allowed LeBron to get this comfortable that he felt he could do this in the 2nd round!

Marathoners usually taper two weeks. Ultramarathoners taper 3 weeks or more. It can drive some runners batty as they want to run frequently and run far.

526,"1) Built like Adonis 

2) He's so physically intimidating people often even just avoid contact with him. That and even when they contact him on say drives it has no impact on him. You can hack him all you want....if you cant knock him to the ground it becomes alot less likely youll truly injure him no matter how hard the contact you make with him is. And yes it's not easy to knock LeBron to the ground unless you blatantly try some bush league type move which rarely happens in an NBA game. 

3) Incredibly well conditioned. Haberstroh talked yesterday about how those Heat teams when they first got their trained with the Air Force(or maybe it was the Army). Point is....nobody can ever question LeBron's conditioning. 

4) Has always picked his spots to some extent. Even when he was young he always had perspective ie ""This is just some random game in January in Atl that means squat there's no point going all out and exerting everything I have and taking risks"". 

5) And yes a good part of it is just luck. Remember say at hte end of game 7 when he went up for a dunk that Draymond fouled him on. He landed on his wrist and it really looked like he had broken his wrist. Nope....he shot the game sealing FT right after that. Things like that are just pure luck; there's nothing that unique about his wrist where if he lands on it 10+ ft in the air his wont break while anybody else's in the world would.

873,"I grew up watching the NBA in the 80s and so I witnessed the rise of MJ and saw him ball during his absolute peak. I maintain to this day that he's the greatest of all time, that if my life depended on winning a single game, I'd start my team with him over any other player. There was just nothing like watching him overcome all obstacles, never to stumble once he reached the pinnacle, and just have a feel of invincibility. I am very biased, but I think however you dissect it, MJ was just better than Lebron. 

Having said that, it's shit like this that makes me rethink the matter and question if in fact MJ is empirically better than Lebron. When he retired, there was a general consensus that no one -- NO ONE -- would ever be as good. Even during Kobe's height people never really considered him to challenge MJ's throne. But with Lebron, I question if MJ will in fact be remembered as the GOAT. Years from now, when the next generation of fans grow up not having see MJ play at all, and not having seen his impact on the game live, and all you have to base these comparisons is off of stats, it will be very difficult to argue against Lebron. Overall, Lebron's statistics and longevity will be probably be unmatched. Lebron is a freaking beast, and it's shit like this that really shows the older generation that it's not necessarily written in stone that MJ is -- and will always be -- the greatest of all time.

961,"For those wondering like me, LeBron is #9 all time in playoff games played with 200.

If the Cavs make the finals and average 6 games per series, he'll move into 5th or 6th. He would pass Pippen (208), Shaq (216), and Kobe (220).

Tony Parker is ahead of him with 214, so he could catch him as well if the Spurs go home much earlier. Manu Ginobili is right behind him with 198, so if the Spurs last longer (or play more games on the way), he'd lose a spot.

If he catches Bryant, the top 4 would be Kareem (237, probably catch him next year), Horry (244, maybe catch him next year), Duncan (251, probably catch him in two years), and Derek Fisher (259, ditto for two years).

We'll probably see LeBron demolish the record for career playoff games before he hangs them up. At five more seasons averaging 20 playoff games a year, he'd hit 300.

Cool bonus fact: that also means 3 of the top 10 players in playoff games played are from the Spurs dynasty, and 4 of the top 10 touched the Lakers (although for two, a significant chunk of their playoff games came from different franchises).",44,Euthy,/r/nba/comments/65zkjx/nbalebron_james_passes_magic_johnson_358_for_3rd/dgehgza/,dgehgza,1492508423.0,1492479623.0,[NBA]LeBron James passes Magic Johnson (358) for 3rd on the all-time NBA Playoffs steals list!,336,65zkjx
