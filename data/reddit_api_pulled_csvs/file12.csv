238,"At the end of his career, I think Lebron will be(or will have held) #1 in these playoff categories:  
* Games Played/Games Started  (42 behind Derek Fisher in Games Played)
* Minutes (243 behind Duncan)
* FGs Made (3rd right now, 174 makes behind KAJ)  
* FG Attempts(3rd, 3 shots behind Kobe)  
* 2pt FGs(505 behind KAJ)  
* 2pt FG Attempts(924 behind KAJ)  
* 3pt FG Attempts(#1 today, Curry may pass before Lebron retires)  
* FGs missed(171 behind Kobe)  
* FTs made(#1 today)  
* FT Attempts(#2, 339 behind Shaq)  
* Defensive Rebounds(#3, 494 behind Duncan)  
* Steals(#2, 6 behind Pippen)  
* Turnovers(#1)  
* Points(#1)  
  
That's 14/20 counting stats on Basketball Reference.  The other six stats:  
*3PT FG Made(Lebron is #2, 54 behind Ray Allen.  Curry is 17 behind Lebron.  Curry has averaged 34 makes/year the past three years, Curry has averaged 83 makes/year the past three. Lebron should be #2 with a small chance to be #1 for a short time if series are extended for him this year.)  
* Offensive rebounds(Lebron is #32, should easily slide in top 15, decent chance for top 10.)  
* Total Rebounds(Lebron is #7 now, small chance to get #3, Duncan, who is 977 away. #1 Russell(2182 away) and #2 Wilt(1991 away) are impossible to reach.)  
* Blocks(Lebron is #21.  Probably can get to top 5(D. Robinson #5, 103 away), but he will have to more than double his blocks to reach Shaq at #4(250 away)  
* Assists(Lebron is #3.  Should pass Stockton, 350 away, but it will be difficult to reach Magic at #1, 857 assists away.)  
* Personal Fouls(Lebron is #25.  He should accumulate enough to get to the top #5(Pippen is #5, 169 away).)  
  
Lebron has almost more everything than anyone in every stat in the playoffs.  The only players in this league who will have more are all-time centers in offensive rebounds, total rebounds, blocks, and fouls, the best 3 point shooter in NBA history, and the best point guard in NBA history.

I just see Durant/Curry as a toss up in terms of who has the better season. You know the Warriors will have the best record in the NBA if they try and Durant and Curry will both have insane efficiency and solid volume numbers. If the Warriors still are clearly better than every other West ""super team"" (which I kinda expect) I could see the media turning their attention to a Warriors MVP. 

Also, and this is just a little prediction but with Durant taking the world by storm in the finals, becoming extremely active on social media and going on Simmons pod every other week..I could see an unnecessary media narrative of ""don't forget about Curry"" kicking in and giving him a boost during a hot streak.

276,"#### Methodology

* I start by getting odds for each team from [Bovada](https://sports.bovada.lv/)
* I convert each of the odds to the implied probability from that bet (e.g. Kawhi +350 becomes 100 / 450 = 22.2%)
* All players' implied probabilities add up to roughly 151% (i.e. Bovada charges extra premium to make some money off our bets)
* I divide each probability by the sum to ""normalize"" the probabilities to 100%
* Note: Many people often claim these just reflect what the market thinks, and they aren't actually implied probabilities. Technically this is true, but I think most of the large sports betters are fairly smart, so mid-market odds should be a good estimator of probabilties.

At a cutoff of 25%, James Harden and Chris Paul break into spots 2 and 4.  At 20%, the list is topped by Kevin McHale and then Kawhi Leonard.  Any of those numbers could easily be argued as high usage.

310,"The last clip in the article is a really good one.  Worth re-watching.

Horns set with Kyrie in one corner (with that classic Randy Moss ""the ball isn't coming to me this play"" body language), and Love and Thompson up top.  Lebron accepts TT's screen, quick reversal to Love up high, Love with an immediate DHO to JR, and Love's gravity as a popper creates a wide-open look for JR as two defenders run at Love and abandon the ball.  

You can run that exact same play with Crowder in Kyrie's spot.

Another play I wish Lowe used, but I can't find:  

Out of a timeout in the '17 Finals, the Cavs ran a set play where Love sets a pindown for Korver, which they had just done a few moments before in the game and the Warriors had cheated the screen to deny Korver the ball.  This time Love slipped the screen and caught a lob.

Those are very hard actions to defend with two guys who shoot as well as Love and Korver/JR.  I think this year the Cavs will have a lot more stuff with Love doing that.  Love at the elbow initiating DHOs with secondary playmakers (not Lebron), and Love setting pindowns for Korver/JR.

313,"love isn't really a terrible fit against the warriors, it's just harder for lebron to get the ball to love where he likes it if he's not on the perimeter

kyrie being ass at passing/facilitating more or less doomed love to not be able to be the post player he was so great at with minnesota

to be completely honest, kyrie wasn't even better than kevin love, but he was the second option because he was a better scorer, i would argue love is closer to the top 10 players than kyrie is, just because if kyrie isn't doing iso, he's not really doing anything, love can hit the 3, and do very well on the post and grab boards on the offensive end

a bad passer with kyrie and lebron's style kind of not allowing love to be as good on the post wasn't the best of fits for love

it's not a knock on lebron at all either, people just clog the paint when he has the ball because they have to, so it kind of makes it impossible for a good inside guy to do much unless they're like an athletic big that can pick and roll and dunk like TT

but love isn't athletic like that, and TT is a little small, so neither of them really benefit tons from lebron drives",71,mapletree23,/r/nba/comments/702giv/lowe_remember_kevin_love_lebron_and_the_cavs_need/dmzwdxe/,dmzwdxe,1505430147.0,1505401347.0,Lowe: Remember Kevin Love?

> ... when I wrote that Kobe may be the most complete offensive player of all time, I was referring to his overall skill set. His dribbling and long-range shooting are better than M.J.'s were, and his creativity and athleticism are practically on par. But I agree with you about the leadership comment. Michael figured out how to lift up the level of his teammates' play, and his defense and overall game management were better than Kobe's. And M.J. won six titles, none with a dominant big man to play next to. That's why ultimately there's no argument that Jordan was the better player.

>...But the fact is, there are facets of Kobe's game that are better than Michael's – in particular, dribbling and perimeter shooting. **Michael was more explosive, and he's by far the greatest player ever, but in baseball parlance, Kobe's ""stuff"" might be a little better.**",196,findingthekobeh0mer,/r/nba/comments/6zbxm0/steve_kerr_after_2017_finals_it_is_lebron_and/dmuby1y/,dmuby1y,1505129405.0,1505100605.0,"Steve Kerr after 2017 Finals: ""It is LeBron and Michael Jordan at the top""",451,6zbxm0

Curry to me is like Shaq. Does Durant have better overall abilities than Shaq? Yea, I think so. But Shaq demanded such absolute attention to stop him with his much more specific skill set.

413,"Let's put Schroeder as their point guard and Clint Capela (?) as the center...

I would want to load up on two-way wings who can shoot. The only way you're gonna win is by stretching their defense out and having a bevy of wings who can guard 2-4. 
 
1. Steph Curry at point. Bit of an obvious choice. 
2. Westbrook at the 2. Not a natural fit but I think he matches up best out of any defender against Kawhi, and he's a good enough shooter that he can create spacing. With Steph, he makes a ton of sense because you can essentially play in transition *all the time*, even a 5 on 4 break could result in some sort of bucket. 
3. Hayward at the 3. Probably my most controversial choice but, as I said, I want talented wings. Hayward's versatility here is really attractive, he's a good ball handler and playmaker who can find Steph and Westbrook at the right moments, he can score at all three levels (especially as a shooter and in transition, where he was 95% percentile IIRC), and I think he makes a ton of sense with George as a defensive pairing. 
4. George at the 4. Going small with this team makes sense, and as much as George doesn't want to admit it, he's the ideal small ball 4 because of his strength. He's primarily known as a lockdown perimeter defender but he's proven to be a legitimately good help defender, and I'd want to create a switch heavy scheme between him and Hayward, and this is where Hayward makes sense. Neither of those guys stack up *great* against Durant/LeBron, but I think they have a good combination of strength and speed to be able to guard the guys on the perimeter and inside. Durant basically becomes the biggest mismatch, but this is where my final piece comes in...
5. Davis at center. Probably the biggest position advantage this team would have. As a roll man, Davis is beyond fantastic, and I think he would feast on Capela, and the pick and rolls you can run between him and any of these 4 guys (especially Steph) are deadly. But I think where he excels best is on defense -- you can leave, say, Westbrook on Capela and use Davis on the weak side to double whoever has the ball, or create a bit of a zone scheme and have Davis provide rim protection. I would even consider matching him up *against* Durant because of his wingspan. Either way, Davis would be a monster here, and if the team wins, it'd be because of Davis' interior defense and Curry's shooting. 

I think this team would have the best chance out of any of the 5. LeBron concerns me more than anyone else there, I don't think there's any good answer against what he can do near the basket, but he's also ball-dominant so hopefully his offense would become more predictable than ours (I think with Steph, who's really good at playing off-ball, you could switch between him and Russ as the primary ballhandler).",49,,/r/nba/comments/6yziut/if_current_kawhi_durant_and_lebron_were_all_on/dmrdevn/,dmrdevn,1504956801.0,1504928001.0,"If current Kawhi, Durant, and LeBron were all on the same team and played the 2, 3, and 4 respectively, would any combination of current players be able to challenge them?",108,6yziut

507,"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there. Elimination game stats hate Kobe Bryant. The first question to ask: why? Why do these stats hate him? The obvious answer: they didn't watch him in his prime. Likely explanation: I know that these stats are a few decades old. That means that they only got into basketball in the last couple years. So they never watched Mamba in his prime. And because they didn't watch him in his prime, they try to compensate for that by diving inside themselves into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment elimination game stats bring up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball. Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game. So when I hear elimination game stats say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you elimination game stats, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better. You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you were a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that. Elimination game stats would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever. So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch elimination game stats. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults.

I can get wanting to get away from Lebron to make his own way but I swear in every aspect of his life he feels the need to be the center of attention.

News flash Kyrie, your opinion is no more valid than anyone else on (the round) earth. If people should listen to you develop an informed, intelligent opinion like Lebron or Melo. 

If you spout anti-intellectual nonsense like the Earth is flat and other BS conspiracy theories you're just a nut.

They have become so taken for granted it's amazing. I had someone the other day telling me that Durant didn't play well in game 4 of the Finals because he *only* shot 9/22 from the field even though he put up 35/4/4 and 2 blocks on the road in a potential series-clinching Finals game.

The list of players to have ever even scored 35 points in a Finals game, let alone average it for the series, isn't very long. 

The move that Durant made (and the move that LeBron made in 2011) were received so poorly because at the end of the day we know how transcendent both of them are as players. The idea that they could leave their franchises to join up with another top 5 player and a top 15 player (or 2 top 20 players in Durant's case) seemed unfair.

While the Celtics didn't have a Lebron, they did have a fantastic offensive system that got IT tons of open looks.  And you cannot overlook what Horford does for spacing - centers with that kind of ability to move the ball don't really exist, and Cleveland certainly doesn't have one.

753,"One of the biggest aspects no one wants to talk about is the max contract the Cavs can offer him, and its way more complicated than just the extra a year and money the Cavs can offer by having his bird rights. 

During the last CBA negotiations, CP3 and LeBron successfully made it so teams can offer full length max deals to players who will turn 38 by the end of the contract. It used to be 36 years old. 

LeBron turns 33 this season, meaning if he signed a five year max, he would be 38 by the time it ends. Matches up perfectly. Chris Paul opted in and got himself traded to Houston so they would have his Bird Rights and could do the exact same thing for him. 

Now many people would say LeBron doesn't need the extra money, he's basically a billionaire, and that's true. It's not about the money for LeBron and hasn't been since he opted out in 2014 and said he would only be taking the max. It's all about power and player empowerment. It seems LeBron learned a lot in his time in Miami about leverage and what teams will do and say to try and undercut a players negotiating power, and LeBron understands that him making concessions makes it more difficult for every present and future NBA player to negotiate for their full value if LeBron doesn't do it for himself. 

 This is why LeBron has been holding Gilbert's feet to the fire season after season. He's never going to get played like he did by Riley ever again and if he does it DAMN sure it won't be Dan Gilbert who plays him. He's gonna make him sweat over and over and over and finally when it comes time he will take the absolute largest contract in NBA history.

886,"EDIT: Yo. I did not expect this thread to explode like it did, usually threads about this subject go for 10-15 comments and that's it. If had of known before hand I would have edited this down severely to be specifically about Kawhi defending Lebron not everything else which did cause a stir but good discussion nonetheless.

As you might notice a few (rightly so) comments have [linked me where all this ""analysis"" is from](http://nobodytouchesjordan.blogspot.com/2014/09/section-13-lebron-doesnt-have-enough.html) (Although I did not get it from there, or the site has changed since I have) which I have said in this post was not all my words and in others that I did pull this from various places on the net. I have 3 or so versions of this in my home computer which i'll get to in the holidays that have more information about that finals and Kawhi's effect but this was the only version I had saved in RES (notice how there is a random reddit comment qoute with the average at the top?) and just so happened to be either the original or close to it. I formatted it quickly and took out the vitriol about Lebron then quickly gave up because I needed to go to sleep, stayed on to answer some questions then did fall asleep lol. 

If I had known this would blow up instead of the usual 10-15 comment thread I would have been much more concise and stuck to Kawhi defending Lebron and looked for the original sources before posting, I'll be editing this to clear up my wording because at the time I just posted it without thinking to much.

>> 2014 finals(Kawhi)

>> Kawhi in that Finals averaged 17.8--6.4--2.0--1.6--1.2

>> Lebron in that Finals averaged 28.2--7.8--4.0--2.0--0.4

EDIT: SEE ABOVE

Helped put this together quite some time ago, not everything is my words especially the stat padding but he did do some of that: 

Games 3-4-5

Lebron scored 51 of his 81 points (63%) being down 15+

Leonard scored 27 of his 71 points (38%) being up 15+

Leonard outscored Lebron 44-30 in non-blowout situations

Leonard 23.7 ppg on 69%

LeBron 27.0 ppg on 55% (Leonard 14% more efficient)

And again, Lebron stats were heavily padded in garbage time, in non blowout situations Leonard outscored him

Leonard 9.3 rpg LeBron 7.7 rpg

Leonard 2.0 spg LeBron 1.7 spg

Leonard 2.0 bpg LeBron 0.7 bpg

Leonard 2.3 apg with 1.7 TOpg LeBron 4.7 apg with 3.7 TOpg

Leonard had a slightly better ast:TO ratio

Through games 3-4-5, Leonard scored much more efficiently (and more in non blowout situations) and outrebounded, outstole, and outblocked Lebron with a better ast:TO ratio

* Game 3

Lebron had 14 points and 0 TO in first quarter, then 8 points and 7 TOs for the last 3 quarters. LeBron had 22-5-7-5 with 7 TOs on 64%, Wade had 22-4-2-2 with 5 TOs on 67%. 

But over the last 3 quarters, LeBron had 8 points and 7 TOs to Wade's 20 points and 3 TOs. The Heat cut the lead from 15 to 9 without LeBron, after Wade subbed in for him, from the 5:00 to 1:00 mark of the 3rd quarter, but even with that help LeBron still lost.

* Game 4

Lebron had 9 points in first half and the Heat were blown out by 19 at halftime. He padded his stats from there, and he **did not score on Leonard in the first half.**

* Game 5

Lebron had 1 FG in 2nd quarter (2:30 mark) to bring the Heat within 5. Then he did not score again until the Heat were down 21 with 4:40 in the 3rd. **LeBron shot 1-6 against Leonard this game.**

Leonard clearly outplayed Lebron over the final 3 games, even with Lebron padding his stats, and Lebron failed to score consistently until after his teams were getting blown out. LeBron did not play well in the 2014 Finals after Game 2, this ""Oh his efficiency and he was unguardedable"" is uninformed bullshit.

In Game 3, LeBron had 14 points in the 1st quarter, then 8 points and 7 turnovers in the last 3 quarters. In Game 4, LeBron had 9 points in the first half, and they were blown out by 19 at that point.
Lebron's efficiency and volume was higher against non kawhi defenders also.

Kawhi's On Court Defense 100.3 DRTG

Off Court Defense 116.3 DRTG

Also, whereas Lebron could never guard Leonard, **Leonard held Lebron to 1-6 shooting in Game 5 when he guarded him**. In Game 5 Lebron had 1 FG in the 2nd quarter (2:30 mark) to bring the Heat within 5, and never scored again until the Spurs were up 21 with 4:40 left in the 3rd. In the 4 combined Heat losses, Lebron scored 48% of his points when the Spurs were up 15+.

http://www.espn.com/blog/statsinfo/post/_/id/91407/kawhi-leonard-wreaking-havoc-on-lebron

He was outplayed significantly by Kawhi, was denied shots by Kawhi better than anyone and that was Lebrons 2nd worst finals individually.

893,"Look, Kawhi definitely played great defense on LeBron. But don't forget that basketball is still played with 5 people on the court for each team. The 2014 Miami Heat were terrible outside of LeBron (Bosh was okay, but not great either), especially Wade (15.2/3.8/2.6 on 43/33/69) + the role players could not keep up with SAS at all.	

Spurs may have gone with single coverage against LeBron with Kawhi, but they were ready and eager to help at all times because they know the rest of the Heat roster can't hurt them. Seriously, look at the [stats of the other players.](https://www.basketball-reference.com//playoffs/2014-nba-finals-heat-vs-spurs.html)

Games 3-5 were essentially over after the first or second quarter...it was clear the Spurs were that much better than the Heat. Should the starters be pulled out at halftime...? It's the Finals, you keep playing no matter what.

tl;dr

Kawhi played great D on LeBron (probably the best individual defender against him, along with Iggy), but it's easier for the entire team to contain an opposing player when you don't have to worry about the rest of the team.

the lakers won 42 games in a competitive west with 5 teams with 50+ wins, including 2 with 60+. the cavs won 50 games in a weak east with 2 teams with 50+ wins (including themselves) and none with 60+.

the lakers faced a 61-team suns, and would have faced the 58-win spurs in round 2 if they'd won, then a 51-win jazz team in the WCF if they'd won again. the cavs faced .500 teams in the first two rounds of the playoffs and a post-ben wallace pistons team in the ECF.

kobe averaged 32/5/6 on .463/.344/.868 splits that year. lebron averaged 27.3/6/7 on .476/.319/.698 splits.

984,"Michael Jordan, most younger fans have no idea how much grief he got until he broke through in 1991.  Then he cemented it with a threepeat.

But wait, there's more.  After his first retirement the Bulls did shockingly well without him.  They didn't win a championship but their regular season was almost the same and they did well in the playoffs.

Meanwhile, Jordan struggled with the curve ball in baseball.  Then when there was a lockout in baseball he returned to the Bulls in the spring of 1995, but something was off and he was embarrassed by the Magic (young Shaq, young Penny, and his old teammate Horace Grant) in the playoffs.  During the summer of 1995 some were wondering whether time had passed him by, and whether he was really the GOAT.

He answered his critics with a 72 win season and then cemented his reputation with a *second* threepeat, plus two more MVPs and three more FMVPs.",35,wjbc,/r/nba/comments/6um1ai/one_of_the_greatest_things_about_the_nba_is_when/dltpcjj/,dltpcjj,1503132767.0,1503103967.0,"One of the greatest things about the NBA is when often-criticized superstars win their first title: Lebron, KD, and Dirk are great examples, what are your favorite NBA championship redemption stories?",18,6um1ai
