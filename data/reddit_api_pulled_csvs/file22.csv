>The hours didn’t get any easier after Bridgeman began working for himself, after retiring at age 33 in 1987. Seizing on a love of hamburgers, Bridgeman bought five Milwaukee-area Wendy’s (WEN, +1.16%) franchises. He insisted on working in every facet of the business, from flipping burgers to mopping the floors—to the point where it was often hard for an outsider to tell who was the boss. Once while working the line at a restaurant, he could feel a woman regarding him quizzically, as if trying to figure out where she knew him from. The next day, Bridgeman was listening to a local radio talk show when a caller broke in: **“I was at Wendy’s, and I saw Junior Bridgeman working behind the counter,” the woman groused. “If that’s the best these ex-athletes can do ...”**",28,ilovefiveguys,/r/nba/comments/5supux/richest_bball_players_1mj_2magic_3lebron_4junior/ddi6c3v/,ddi6c3v,1486619024.0,1486590224.0,"Richest bball players: 1.MJ, 2.Magic, 3.LeBron, 4.Junior Bridgeman?",313,5supux

Lebron did take it really personally with his response to Chuck's criticism, but at the same time you could argue that calling out a player's competitive spirit (especially a player like Lebron) *is* making things personal. 

Both Shaq/Chuck are right. In the end I just think Lebron's been quiet frustrated over the Cav's subpar record last month. Maybe he's also concerned about the lack of a playmaker and father time ticking away at him; and GSW steamrolling everyone out there. Who knows. Bottom line is that his explosive response to Chuck was very extreme in comparison to the criticisms levelled against him, and with Barkley making is closing remarks tonight it makes Lebron's look the lesser man.

 The Cavs pay-roll is apparently the biggest ever and Gilbert and co. have done everything to surround LeBron with the best talent available. Why would he go public with this sort of stuff?

But I feel like I've been hearing about this stuff for *weeks.* Plus it's not like Gilbert is going to be like ""Well we have 250m on the cap so we're not going to go and get a PG who makes 5m a year."" Like 5m at that rate is chump change. 

Now LeBron's put the FO in a weird spot. Now every single team knows that they *need* a point guard and will create high false value. The Mavs, my team for example, just today there was a rumor going around that we wanted Shumpert *and* a first round pick for *Deron Williams.* That's exactly the type of stuff the front office is going to get asked for now.

769,"The thing that separates what Charles said from what Kenny said was the thing about competitiveness -- that was utter bullshit because everything over the last few years has shown LeBron to be a phenomenal competitor.

At the same time, I think people need to realize that Charles and Kenny generally did have a valid point. They weren't saying that asking for a playmaker was inappropriate. They were saying that the **extent** of Lebron's lobbying for a new playmaker, to the point of laying it out to the media, was inappropriate. Which i think, all things considered with the Cavs payroll situation, Griffin's activeness in the trade market, and Gilbert's perennially loose purse strings, and generally how absurdly good the Cavs roster is, is indeed a valid criticism.

Also, aside from the ridiculous questioning of LeBron's competitiveness, Charles also seemed quite complementary of Lebron - great player, great person, and he was also coming from the perspective of wanting to see LeBron solidify his legacy by beating the Warriors/Spurs without any additional help.

Lebron's verbal destruction of Charles was funny, factually accurate, but also very uncalled for. Many of the things being said were ad hominem, and had absolutely nothing to do in context with basketball. I can understand that this might have been accumulated ill-will over the years from Charles and his constant yapping about the deficiencies of modern NBA players compared to in the past etc etc, but even so, I don't think Charles had any malicious intent or had done anything to actually damage LeBron's legacy.

Nothing Charles said/has said in the past seems to warrant such a verbal beatdown.",31,gyxorz,/r/nba/comments/5r8wxr/heres_the_video_that_sparked_lebron_calling_out/dd5f26n/,dd5f26n,1485911299.0,1485882499.0,Here's the video that sparked Lebron calling out Charles Barkley after the game last night,545,5r8wxr

898,"Here is my issue with whats going on with the Cavs and LBJ, and why I think he should just play ball:

- LBJ is currently the highest paid player in the league at nearly $31M per year. His crime partners Klove and Kyrie are getting $21.2M and $17.6M. 

- LBJ currently makes $50M+ per year on endorsement deals... Thats the most of ANY pro-athlete. If LBJ wanted depth at EVERY position, its impossible to do with a hard cap space, unless HE takes a paycut. 

- LBJ was involved in the Tristan Thompson contract. He was very public about Cavs signing TT at any cost, he pointed out its their NUMBER ONE PRIORITY. TT's agent happens to also be Rich Paul. With LBJ's balls deep in Dan Gilbert's throat, he had no choice but to dish out $82M over 5 years. I understand his defensive value, but TT averages 9.4pts/8.6reb (which I would argue it makes his stats look better than it actually is)... I can understand why Dan Gilbert was VERY hesitant to pay him $82M. Look at TT's individual stat line every night, for an $18M/year player, this guy CONSISTENTLY puts up nights with 2 pts, 4 pts... 

- Dan Gilbert even paid JR Smith!!! Nuff said. 

- Ever since LBJ's return to Cavs, Dan has done nothing but spend money. Their payroll is the highest in those years, and paid the most taxes. This is something I was very surprised Gilbert was willing to do, but I guess he has no choice. 

- LeBron didn't like Blatt, even though management supported him. But Dan fired Blatt anyways to please Bron. 

**Now lets analyse the trigger to the recent LBJ rant**

At the time of writing this, Cavs played 12 games in January, and lost 7. Lets focus in on the losses here:

- Chicago Bulls: 8th seed in the east, below .500. This team is a hot mess right now, and we seen this coming in the off-season. There is absolutely NO GODDAMN REASON, the Cavs team should have lost here, with or without the playmaker that LBJ is demanding right now. Cavs are too talented to be taking an L here.

- Utah Jazz - 5th seed in the West, not a bad team. But talent wise, experience wise they cannot compare to the Cavs. LBJ was matched up against Hayward, and Hayward shot 10/12... Who is to blame here? Would a veteran minimum playmaker helped in this case? 

- Portland Trailblazers - out of playoffs contention in the West for now. Hovering above .400. How in the world did the defending champs lose here? They had Allan Crabb come off the bench and shoot 9/11, LBJ being the best player in the league was not able to slow that down... But a veteran playmaker definitely would have helped? 

- Golden State Warriors: This was a battle of the titans game. Best team in the NBA (GSW) vs the second best. Everyone expected this to be a close game, full of action. Again, Cavs did not even make this one RESPECTABLE, and LBJ shot 33% with 6 TO... As the best player on the planet, how can you excuse your performance? But it was a game I expected them to lose, so they can get a small pass here. But the margin of the loss is just disgusting. 

- San Antonio Spurs: Again, a top tier team. this game went down to the wire and LBJ made a clutch shot to send them to OT. But LBJ's match up Kawhi went off for 41 pts, thats kind of on Lebron. This is probably the ONLY GAME over their losing stretch, where I think having another veteran ball handler would have benefited the Cavs. 

- New Orleans Pelicans: Pelicans were playing without Anthony Davis. That's all I have to say here... 

- Sacramento Kings: Rudy Gay (their second highest usage rate after Boogie), was out. Kings are a .400 team near the bottom of the West. Did Dan Gilbert not give LeBron enough to win over Kings who did not even have Gay???? 

*Cavs are going through a rough stretch of basketball, and that is just the course of the game. Every team has downtime sometimes. But this team needs to look within, cuz the team's they are losing to are just atrocious. Dan Gilbert has done nothing but kiss LBJ's ass for the past 3 years and LeBron needs to chill out. Of the 12 games of 2017, they really should have won at least 9, LBJ needs to hold him self and his team accountable instead of asking for more pieces. You can't be here getting paid the most in the league, get the front office to trade for Klove, get your buddies JR and TT paid on FAT contracts, then complain your roster is not good enough. No LeBron, that excuse does not work right now.*
