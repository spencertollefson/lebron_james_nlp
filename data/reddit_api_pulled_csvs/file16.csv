I have more respect for LeBron James and Kyrie Irving for taking it to this team 100%. What else can LeBron do? The rest of this Cavs team was straight ass. Kevin Love should go take a long hard look in the mirror for being one of the most inconsistent players I’ve seen in awhile. Kyle Korver couldn’t hit the side of a barn. Deron Williams looked like he belonged in the D-League. Tristan Thompson only showed up for a couple games. 

I mean LeBron did everything he could. Basically averaged a triple double but I’m going to have to sit on this sub and watch people trash his legacy because he couldn’t beat this stacked of a team. Whatever man. LeBron is the best player I’ve ever seen .

Him and his mom were certainly not well off, yet he turned down a $10 million deal from Reebok in high school because he believed that he could get more from Nike or Adidas.

How the hell can you live up to those expectations, deal with that pressure from such a young age?  And then for the next 15 years , the only real misstep you take is The Decision, AND you are the within striking distance of the greatest player ever to play the game, living up to even the most ridiculous of expectations?  

EDIT: AND then you have the alternate side of the hype, which is the ridiculous hating that comes along with that.  And it's not a thing that started in 2010 when he went to the Heat.  For example, this forum from Jan 2003 during his senior season: http://www.baylorfans.com/forums/showthread.php?t=24917

Granted, the original poster did have some reasonable points about waiting and seeing how he pans out before hyping him too much.  Very reasonable approach to be honest.  But then you get comments like this:

>Lebron James...all hype not much substance...I saw him play yesterday...0 for 10 from 3 pt land..he blew past nobody..He can't dribble to the left..the only thing that impressed me was that he can use his left hand to an extent...however i didn't see him blow past anyone..I don't think he will be a star...His size won't matter much in a few years..Bill Walton is ridiculous",99,RIP_EddieG,/r/nba/comments/6gucsc/how_do_you_honestly_feel_about_lebron_james/dit4ajf/,dit4ajf,1497323523.0,1497294723.0,How do you honestly feel about LeBron James?,55,6gucsc

97,"I'll get downvoted but whatever. It's because LeBron cries around a lot in the game in a weak baby like way. When MJ and Kobe whine it's more of a tough guy attitude, not like a bitchy kid who doesn't get his way. 

LeBron pulls stupid whiney antics that the players in this generation are starting to copy a lot. Look up GS vs Cavs during this regular season where Green fouls him hard midcourt. He lies face down and acts like he's dead when everybody knew he was trying to sell a flagrant call. Later when OKC played GS, Westbrook did the exact same damn thing LeBron did but against Zaza. 

Another instance is when LeBron flops his head back and acted like he got hit in the eye and then seconds later gets up and winks at someone when he gets the call. This was when they played against the Bulls several years back. No one even touched him and he sold it. 

MJ and Kobe never did this type of shit. If someone actually hit Kobe or MJ they would play it off with a tough guy mentality or go straight into the other players face. They'll call for the foul to the refs but if the ref doesn't seem interested they would just play on. 

MJ and Kobe never flopped when no contact was there. The most they would flop is to exaggerate contact that actually happened. LeBron will flop on ghost plays where he knows refs will call because of where they are standing even when no contact is made. 

LeBron pouts for several plays every now and then, much like Chris Paul does. He has infected the league by setting up a precedent where players are ok with being a weak whiney flopping mentality type of player and it's really disappointing because LeBron is so good.

>This was announced with a several day, narcissistic, self-promotional build-up culminating with a national TV special of his ""decision"" unlike anything ever ""witnessed"" in the history of sports and probably the history of entertainment.

>Clearly, this is bitterly disappointing to all of us.

>The good news is that the ownership team and the rest of the hard-working, loyal, and driven staff over here at your hometown Cavaliers have not betrayed you nor NEVER will betray you.

>There is so much more to tell you about the events of the recent past and our more than exciting future. Over the next several days and weeks, we will be communicating much of that to you.

>You simply don't deserve this kind of cowardly betrayal.

>You have given so much and deserve so much more.

>In the meantime, I want to make one statement to you tonight:

>""I PERSONALLY GUARANTEE THAT THE CLEVELAND CAVALIERS WILL WIN AN NBA CHAMPIONSHIP BEFORE THE SELF-TITLED FORMER 'KING' WINS ONE""

> You can take it to the bank.

> If you thought we were motivated before tonight to bring the hardware to Cleveland, I can tell you that this shameful display of selfishness and betrayal by one of our very own has shifted our ""motivation"" to previously unknown and previously never experienced levels.

>Some people think they should go to heaven but NOT have to die to get there.

>Sorry, but that's simply not how it works.

>This shocking act of disloyalty from our home grown ""chosen one"" sends the exact opposite lesson of what we would want our children to learn. And ""who"" we would want them to grow-up to become.

>But the good news is that this heartless and callous action can only serve as the antidote to the so-called ""curse"" on Cleveland, Ohio.

>The self-declared former ""King"" will be taking the ""curse"" with him down south. And until he does ""right"" by Cleveland and Ohio, James (and the town where he plays) will unfortunately own this dreaded spell and bad karma.

>Just watch.

>Sleep well, Cleveland.

>Tomorrow is a new and much brighter day....

>DELIVERING YOU the championship you have long deserved and is long overdue....

365,"I agree with a lot of what you're saying even though haters will see this as an anti-lebron post. 

I personally think that LeBron's physical ability and basketball IQ is what sets him apart, not necessarily his raw basketball skills. That is crazy to think about though, Lebron is considered a selfless player which I'm not disputing but in a lot of ways his passing is similar to Westbrook, especially in these finals. Lot of ball domination and kick outs where the receiver of the pass better be in the right position to score.",55,CapOnBrimBent,/r/nba/comments/6g5pzx/bizarro_ballhere_is_my_problem_with_lebron_james/dinrl6q/,dinrl6q,1497007707.0,1496978907.0,"""Bizarro Ball"".....Here is MY problem with Lebron James",79,6g5pzx

367,"As a huge LBJ fan (he's my favorite player) I hate the amount he passes sometimes.  I don't care if it's the right basketball play in the end of games or a scoring drought.  You're supposed to shoulder the responsibility yourself and make something happen.  This makes defending the Cavaliers so easy for the Warriors, they know players are just going to stand around until LBJ kicks the ball.  If Kyrie didn't have his finishing ability, that game would not have been that competitive and they wouldn't have won last year either.  I give more credit to Kyrie's scoring ability last year for the turn around honestly.


As for LBJ's offensive game... it has been known he is not a finesse player.  He never had foot work or was a jump shooter.  His game is very simple and yet no one can stop him, that's what makes him special.  That's a testament to his talent alone, increasing his scoring record every year.  He ability to finish and make good players has created an offense around him for his entire career lol... and it is still working as a system for over the last half decade.  LBJ isn't going to embarrass you by playing you for a fool with his dribbles and shake and bakes or anything, he's taking the ball right at you.  


LBJ's teams have always had one key weakness and that is they do turn into standing around, like you mention, until LBJ moves and they go into their expected positions.  No one is moving off the ball trying to create a nice back screen or cut.  I agree completely with this point, that has always been a central weakness of LBJ's teams.",24,go_hard_today,/r/nba/comments/6g5pzx/bizarro_ballhere_is_my_problem_with_lebron_james/dintukf/,dintukf,1497010945.0,1496982145.0,"""Bizarro Ball"".....Here is MY problem with Lebron James",79,6g5pzx

One thing you may want to consider is that LeBron is in some ways his own worst enemy by being not only a player (and arguably somewhat of a coach) , but also a pseudo GM.  Because LeBron had crappy GMs and coaches early in his career, he never learned to trust their decisions.

He has really no game plan other than Kyrie iso's when Lebron is off the court. He doesn't have any secondary motions after the first offball motion is killed.

665,"It's funny people are raving about KD's denfense like its never been done at his level before. I mean there is a guy in San Antonio that has been doing this all season long what KD is doing in the Finals. He led his team to a 61 win record while carrying his team offensively and defensively with significantly less talent supporting him than what KD has. 

Yea it's easy to play defense on a team that has the greating shooting backcourt in league history. 

Just like Kenny Smith said, all KD has to do is make the bed and fluff the pillows.

Not hating on KD but these Sports media guys who cant get on TV unless they make  a ""Hot Take"" needs to calm tf down. 

Edit: Grammar

EDIT: I think some of you are missing the point here. People in the media want to anoint him as the best player in the world just because of how he is playing right now but forget to realize that the other two guys he is competing with as ""best in the word"" have less helps and more weight to carry than him. Kawhi was just used as an example, I did not say that Kawhi was being overlooked or underrated. 
And I find it really funny that Kawhi was pretty much labeled a system player for 3 years because he benefited from the system he was in, but KD is being called the ""best player in the world"" while he is in a system that heavily benefits him way more than the Spurs System did for Kawhi. Lol.

Edit: I should've made a stronger point than the rings case at the end, but I think most you get the picture. We've been comparing LeBron to Jordan for a few years now.

733,"I disagree. If you ever watch the Cavs play, NO teams trap him on PnR unless they're desperate for a steal. Why? Because it's dumb to force arguably the best passing wing ever to make a play off a double. 

Actually, if you're watching the games, they are clearly strongly shadowing LeBron's drives on the weakside (like most teams). They either have KD or Green on Love, and you'll always see them play off of him to protect the rim. If LeBron passes it, they're unbelievable at rotating and anyways, Green and KD have the length to contest the shot even one pass away. 

It's also much harder for LeBron to drive because his defender is usually also either KD or Green. They have great length and are very hard to drive against. Half the time he's basically going against one and then if he gets past them, has to face the other. Both KD and Green have shown to be great rim protectors.

So, they actually do care if LeBron goes off for 40. They're actively protecting the rim, but have so many great defenders that they can easily rotate and make it look like they're stuck onto the shooters. Also, they are actively looking to box out TT, but it really isn't because they don't care if Bron scores. 

They're honestly not doing anything special. Cavs have been running mainly PnR. They have been either switching or Curry has been hedging perfectly and the defender goes under the screen. This is the classic plan vs LeBron.

Steve Kerr is a great coach, but he's no genius for doing this. The Warriors are just one of the greatest teams of all time on both sides of the floor.

In 2010 the Hawks lost against the Dwight led Magic mainly due to Dwight feeding shooters out of the post to beat the double team on him. In 2011 it with largely the same team except the Hawks had fired Mike Woodson and put Larry Drew in charge. Now I don't think anyone is calling Larry Drew a genius but he did have one good idea and it is exactly what you are talking about here.

749,"Is anyone else tired of hearing the term 'superteam'? Its lost all meaning and never had a coherent definition anyways. To win a championship, you need some combo of elite superstar(s), a great set of complementary role players, and great coaching. So what the hell is a superteam anyways, is it just the players on the floor with no regard for coach quality? Is it just your stars with no regard for the role players? Because role players and coaches are enormously important, any championship team could be framed as a super team. Is it the way the team is built, free agency vs. through the draft?  That distinction matters in terms of how you view an organization, but why should that change the view of a player? Its not like KD or Lebron are the ones drafting and developing the players on their own teams, they have to trust that their team drafts good talent. Some teams are just bad at that, and so we should expect a player to waste away on not quite good enough teams while getting shat on by the fans and media for not winning a ring? 

Some guys can just play great basketball and have the championship ingredients built around them in order to pile up the rings, like Tim Duncan. Some guys like Lebron weren't so lucky and have to go build things for themselves. Some guys have those things but never win just due to bad luck, injuries, and not quite being good enough either on the team or individual level. I'd put Nash, Stockton/Malone, and KD on the Thunder in this category. KD may never have won a ring on the thunder, is that an indictment of him as a player when we see him dominating in the finals now, or is that an indictment of the Thunder supporting cast and organization? If its a black mark on the Thunder, why the hell is KD obligated to stick around? Players realize their legacies rest almost entirely on their ability to win championships, if they don't feel that the right combo of players and coaching is being placed around them where they are playing, they absolutely should leave for greener pastures.

For the lazy, the summary goes like this:  

* Dubs have been all time great on defense these playoffs. They've stopped everything but James' attacks in transition.

* Love is ok.

* JR and TT need to come alive in game 3 or it might be series. Zazza presents an opportunity to bring TT back on the floor and is a tasty mismatch for Kyrie/Lebron if they can get him in isolation (easier said than done).  

* Cavs should look at ways to counter the warriors' new strategy to avoid curry on lebron mismatches.  

* We've seen dubs use curry-durant p-n-r more, saw a curry-klay p-n-r once/twice (worked well last finals g4), and  they've gone for more o-rebs than usual for some reason.

996,"for his size, I think that he is incredibly skilled. though when compared to other players who have extreme finesse in their game like Curry and Kobe then I would agree. But just remember that they play completely different positions and have different height

It's rare to see a guy who is 6'8 tall with that much athleticism, explosiveness and skill. like i said before, when compared to smaller guys he doesn't look as impressive but for his size and physique, it's incredibly impressive what he does.

999,"He plays with less grace than MJ and Kobe; his footwork leaves a bit to be desired. Much of his offensive skillset relies on his athleticism (size, speed, vertical). He scores a huge chunk of his points near the rim. His offensive game is still a work in progress. His jumpshot mechanics are suspect, which is why he airballs a free throw once a year. He's a much better driver than a shooter. His offensive arsenal is incomplete and not all that pretty. He's more beast than artiste.
