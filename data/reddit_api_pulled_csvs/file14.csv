He is by far biggest/baddest force in the jungle.


He comes to the team (any jungle in the world) and builds the powerhouse (gets fat on veggies) while killing future talent (plants).

Everything works well until taxes kick in (Meteor comes).

Once that happens team (World) becomes prohibitively expensive. He bails for another location (Triceritops' have been known to leave planets after global catastrophes) leaving an empty shell (meteor hole) and dead team with little to no future.

100,"You bring up many astute points and a reasonable solution for the type of schemes that could be implemented when James is on the bench. The only point I would challenge you on is that Lue can run the same schemes for Kevin Love as in Minnesota. Love has completely revamped his body by becoming leaner in an attempt to become less injury prone. Yes, now he has become a decent defender (he was actually a plus defender in the Finals) and more nimble, however the trade off is that he cannot dominate in the low post anymore. Thus, throwing the ball to him in the post 15 times a game is no longer efficient enough to be worth trying. However, I definitely do agree with running plays through Love at the elbow; he's a high IQ player who makes great decisions when he has the ball in that spot.

The issue with Irving is he contributes zero to a game outside of isolation scoring. His go-to when the game isn't going well is to iso every time down the court. This is the fundamental reason why I say it would be better to have someone a la Eric Bledsoe or Mike Conley or Kemba Walker who can run an offense and get others involved. Bledsoe and Conley are exceptional defenders for their position, so this is a plus. 

Regarding coaching, you're absolutely right. Lue does not implement any legitimate offensive schemes for when James is off the court. The only solution is to get a different coach imo.",51,newunnavi,/r/nba/comments/6p4ce8/its_wellaccepted_that_the_cavaliers_struggle/dkmhmk6/,dkmhmk6,1500879094.0,1500850294.0,"It's well-accepted that the Cavaliers struggle immensely when Lebron leaves the floor.

Wackstar is only allowed to be around these guys because he's living off of his ""OG's"" street rep. These dumb wannabe down athletes and rappers have to BUY their way into these blood circles.

181,"My theory:

Kyrie asks for a trade because he wants to be the team's best player and he wants to do that for another franchise. He then tweets his peculiar tweet professionally. 

LBJ sees that when Kyrie is dealt, Kyrie may falsely cite LBJ's impending departure as a major influence on his trade request in an attempt to dodge some backlash for leaving. So LBJ leaks Kyrie's request to ensure Kyrie not only gets his full dose of backlash but some of the blame for LBJ's coming exit too.

I concluded that the sixers could afford to tank for a few seasons, provided they kept landing top picks. If those top picks panned out and you took a hyped player, say a Ben Simmons, KAT, or Lonzo Ball, you would benefit greatly due to the concentration of money being brought towards your team and the surrounding economy.",155,,/r/nba/comments/6olkrv/is_having_lebron_really_worth_the_trouble/dkibj2r/,dkibj2r,1500639780.0,1500610980.0,Is having Lebron really worth the trouble?,17459,6olkrv

460,"The warriors had enormous luck to what their dynasty is.  To their full credit though they did an amazing job in assessing talent and drafting the players they did.  No to mention they capitalized on the luck they had and continued the momentum.

Some of the things though that will never happen again which made this dynasty ""Come out of nowhere""
1) Curry's injuries and him signing a very reasonable ~44M extension and then taking off as a MVP player.  Curry's leap was just phenomenal and I do believe a lot has to do with the development at GS.

2) Losing out on the Dwight Howard sweepstakes.  They went after him hard and lost out and ""settled"" for Iguodala instead.  Howard is the better player of course but Iggy is the much better fit for GSW.  At the time though the Iggy signing seemed to be a consolation prize.

3) David Lee's injury.  While I do believe Draymond would eventually be discovered it wasn't a given and Kerr had little choice early on but to start Green over Lee and the rest is history.  (again massive amount of credit to GSW player development with Green)

4)Klay and Dray having their max extension signed before the cap jump, this helps tremendously in today's NBA.  Klay is due 35M for the next two seasons and Draymond 52M over the next 3.  This is ridiculously good value for their talents right now.  (Consider that a guy like Kent Bazemore will make the same as Klay next two years and a guy like Ryan Anderson more than both Klay and Draymond next two years)

5)the cap hike instead of smoothing out the cap allowed them to sign Durant (along with Curry's small contract).  I dont expect this to EVER happen again even if the cap goes up with an even bigger TV contract I think the CBA will smooth out the cap.  Even for the players, last off season we saw a ton of big contracts given out and then this year the market dried up fast with owners being smarter.  That huge cap spike again allowed them to sign Durant at his market value without having to give up anything of their core outside of Barnes (who KD was replacing anyway)


Again while they had a ton of luck/unique opportunities the GSW front office needs to be given a ton of credit for jumping on those.  I remember when they gave Draymond the max there was a lot of talk of an over pay but he has improved since that signing and now is one of the best contracts in the NBA.  While Klay was more deserving of the max to be able to max him before the big cap jumps helped tremendously for them.  Of course now their 'luck' is running out having to pay Curry now his ""market value"", Iggy (getting paid more per year on new contract than old), and KD (despite the discount).  They have an amazing team and have done a job developing talent that is only rivaled by the Spurs IMO, they will have to pay now though for that team.  Discounts though like the on KD made will help them save money though, but outside of injuries to their main 4 I dont see how they will be stopped at least in the next two years (when Klay's contract expires)",256,the_yoyo,/r/nba/comments/6o230o/bill_simmons_at_the_start_of_the_decade_everyone/dkdzweg/,dkdzweg,1500427676.0,1500398876.0,"Bill Simmons: At the start of the decade everyone thought OKC, Chicago, and whatever team Lebron is on is going to rule the decade.

471,"Lebron has a durable and well-portioned body(not like poor Oden) and always had great running and landing mechanics, even back in high school. You never saw him stomp the floor like it owed him money, jarring his bones with every step. He runs and lands lightly, jumps effortlessly(using his core and barely bending knees).  

It's rare but you can notice it with some players. I can't tell if it's taught or they were born with it. Or both. The kind of unique movement that will keep your athleticism going much longer than the normal person. Vince Carter comes to mind. Older ones like Erving, Drexler and Hakeem. Even today, you could see the differences between them and other old big guys. They don't limp and still move pretty well(like Erving's recent dunk vid and Hakeem moving better than Dwight in training) Ewing moves like my grandpa which I think is partly because of his heavy running and not using his core enough to jump.

Derozan is a great example today - he just jumps easily and smoothly, using speed as an assist. I wince when I see Norman Powell slow down, bend legs a lot, then jump hard. It looks good and it works but it takes its toll over time. I kind of went off point, but you get the idea with Lebron. He is a unique one-in-a-million athlete with a body that can withstand and dominate any physical contact sport for many years.

478,"Elite athletes all use the Hyperarch Mechanism. That's why they dont get injured and turn their ankles. All the force goes to their glutes and their ankles stay locked in place.

Look at elite athletes' toes. They're curled back and mangled from being in the hyperarch. All fast runners/high jumpers have it/use the hyperarch, whether they're aware of it or not.

Skinny legs, tight calves, big butts. All things elite athletes have due to the hyperarch. They run on the balls of their feet and lift their knees using their glutes to run/jump insteaf of pulling their weight with their quads like most people.

EDIT.. More info:

gonna just type this out, I hope it doesn't sound too scrambled. 

When I put in that they lift their knees, I mean that they're not extending their leg out in front of them to pull themselves, using their quads. [This is how unathletic people run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27T4TIra9pI), legs extending out in front of them pulling their weight with their quads. It takes them more steps to do so as well. Compare that to [Lebron running a fastbreak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43u_SoEhOGQ) or [Usain Bolt running a 100m](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PH-3cHxXAK0). It takes them fewer steps because they are using their glutes to push themselves forwards while generating more power. At the same time their ankles are locked. Much like a dog or a horse. People wearing shoes, aka cushions under their feet, devolve the body's natural biomechanics. This is why I believe wearing multiple socks is VERY bad for developing athletes. Naturally, kids (or anyone in general) want to take their shoes off during foot races with their friends. It makes them faster as well as feel more comfortable. I can't remember the runner's name, but recently a woman sprinter beat a 100m wr after she switched to flat shoes right before the race. Flat shoes (no cushion) are going to feel more comfortable to these sprinters, helping their biomechanics.

To round it off, look at all the dominating athletes of our time. They all have the same traits. Huge butts, skinny legs, tight calves and messed up feet/toes (the messed up feet are from [pulling the toes towards the heel of the foot](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sWhq-fklefM/maxresdefault.jpg). locking their ankles and getting into the hyperach, which is just a glute nerve connection). Zion Williamson, thicc. James Harden, thicc. Deandre jordan, super skinny legs.. thicc butt. [Jordan](http://images.sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/air-jordan-retrospective-aj1-22.jpg), [Kobe](http://cdn1.thecomeback.com/crossoverchronicles/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2013/12/KobeBryantLakers_TonyAllenGrizzlies121713.jpg), and [tmac](http://www.nba.com/media/playerfile/mcgrady_playfilegallery4.jpg) have some of the skinniest legs you'll see with thick buns.

Example of elite athletes' toes: [lebron](http://dranthonyweinert.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/lebronjames.jpg), [usain bolt](http://i.imgur.com/aURQcnm.jpg), [Michael Jordan](http://media.gettyimages.com/photos/basketball-us-olympic-trials-north-carolina-michael-jordan-gets-his-picture-id452024528) Jordan had CRAZY hyperarch. LOOK AT THOSE FEET.

Another thing these athletes have in common are tendons popping out. Their tendon that runs up the front of the shin and tendons on top of the feet will be visable when they're activating the hyperatch. Only ELITE athletes are in the hyperatch 24/7. [here's](http://lakers.newssurge.com/gallery/d/295522-1/Kobe+Bryant+gets+his+leg+looked+at+before+game+2+vs+OKC+during+the+2012+playoffs.JPG) an example of Kobe's feet tendons popping out.

And of course, the 6 pack comes along naturally for anyone that uses the hyperarch. It takes a lot of core strength to bounce (literally bounce), hyperarch users are all ""bouncy"".

""I don’t know what happened. I just know the shots wouldn’t stop going in. After about the fifth dagger in a row (he made 10 straight), the crowd started groaning on every make — shades of Philly’s Andrew Toney ripping our hearts out 30 years ago. If you’ve ever been in the building for one of those games, you know there isn’t a deadlier sound. He single-handedly murdered one of the giddiest Celtics crowds I can remember. Thirty points in the first half. Thirty! All with that blank look on his face. It was like watching surveillance video of a serial killer coldly dismembering a body and sticking the parts in the fridge. Only we were right there."" ""The fans were so shell-shocked that many (including me and my father) filed out with three minutes remaining, not because we were lousy fans, not to beat the traffic, but because we didn’t want to be there anymore. We wanted to get away from LeBron. He ruined what should have been a magical night. We never really had a chance to cheer, swing the game, rally our guys, anything. He pointed a remote control at us and pressed “MUTE.” It was like being in a car accident. LeBron James ran over 18,000 people."" - Bill Simmons

The pacers GM isn't letting PG come here and Carmelo who I wouldn't trade love for, Maybe shumpert and some other pieces but not love. I don't think the knicks take the shump offer. 

Not a whole lot the cavs can do honestly with the current cap space. Even if we did get PG for love. It doesn't guarantee a win over GS and a Lebron stay. If Lebron left PG would surely follow.

892,"I'm getting pretty sick of this ""LeBron destroys all teams"" story line. No one is blowing up their team because they lose to LeBron in the WCFs every year - basically every team in the NBA would take that. It was age, salaries and bad moves that killed the Hawks. And they were all defensible at the time. The NBA is hard.

The Cavs are imminently beatable. I think that for each of the last 3 seasons, the top 3 or so Western teams would have at least been even odds to beat the Cavs. But the league is imbalanced - we talk about that every day.
