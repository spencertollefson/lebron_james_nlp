**Who's the real No. 1 team in the NBA?**

The Golden State Warriors find themselves in an odd position in some of the most prominent statistical power rankings: second place.

Eight days after the San Antonio Spurs knocked off the Warriors, the question is: How should we rank the teams heading into the playoffs?

As the Warriors chase the best regular-season record in NBA history, they're staring up at the Spurs from the No. 2 spot in ESPN's Basketball Power Index (BPI) as well as Basketball-Reference.com's Simple Rating System and barely ahead in FiveThirtyEight's Carm-Elo rankings.

The discrepancy in the standings, which shows Golden State four games up after San Antonio's short-handed loss Saturday at Oklahoma City, and those rankings can be explained by point differential.

Because point differential is a better predictor of future wins and losses than record, statistical power rankings generally use it as a starting point. And while the Warriors' plus-11.1 differential is very, very good -- only four NBA teams have previously surpassed it -- the Spurs have a superior plus-11.7 differential.

So, does San Antonio really deserve a spot atop league power rankings? Should the Spurs be considered the league's best team approaching the playoffs?

My answer is no, because a variety of different metrics show that Golden State has been better when it's required to be.

**Warriors at their best against the best**

When Golden State lost at San Antonio on March 19, it was notable because it was the first time all season the Warriors had lost to one of the top five seeds in either conference. Depending on how the rest of the season plays out, it's entirely possible that Golden State will lose more games to lottery teams than opponents who make the playoffs.

In fact, the Warriors' performance has been remarkably consistent regardless of the quality of the opposition.

Only against the league's very worst teams has Golden State's margin of victory been appreciably worse. Even then, when we add the opposition's season-long point differential to the outcome of each game, it becomes even clearer that the Warriors have truly saved their best performances for the best opposition -- including their 30-point win over the Spurs at home in January.

By contrast, the Spurs have struggled against the league's best teams, going 5-6 against opponents who have won at least 60 percent of their games (a group that includes Golden State, Oklahoma City, Cleveland, Toronto and the L.A. Clippers) and getting outscored in those matchups. Adjusted for opponent quality, San Antonio has played best against teams around .500.

**Warriors at their best with the game on the line**

Part of the reason Golden State hasn't performed better against weak competition is that those games tend to mean fewer minutes for starters. The team's deep reserves have allowed opponents to make games look more respectable with late runs.

According to Basketball-Reference.com, the Warriors have been outscored by an average of 3.3 points in the fourth quarter when they take a lead of 15 points or larger into the final period. The Spurs have played opponents almost to a draw in these situations (minus-0.1 points per quarter). Removing this garbage time from each team's differential moves Golden State (now plus-12.4) ahead of San Antonio (still plus-11.7).

The bigger the lead, the worse the Warriors play. Seth Partnow of Nylon Calculus broke down each team's net rating per 100 possessions in fourth quarters based on the margin of the game.

[chart](http://i.imgur.com/paPxewf.png)

In ""very low"" leverage situations, where the margin is greater than 21 points, the Spurs have been 31.7 points per 100 possessions better than Golden State. The teams have been similar in high-leverage situations (margin five points or fewer) and low-leverage situations (margin between 16 and 20 points), with the Warriors' huge edge in medium-leverage situations (margin between six and 10 points) making them 8.4 points per 100 possessions better on non-garbage possessions in the fourth quarter.

Looking at the entire fourth quarter includes a lot of bench lineups in even high-leverage situations. Focusing on what NBA.com/Stats defines as ""clutch"" situations, where the margin is five points or fewer in the final five minutes, Golden State becomes even more dominant, outscoring opponents by a preposterous 46.7 points per 100 possessions. The Spurs have the league's next-best net rating at plus-21.4 points per 100 possessions, less than half the Warriors' mark.

Over the two decades for which NBA.com/Stats has compiled clutch data, just two other teams -- the 2008-09 Cleveland Cavaliers and 2012-13 Miami Heat, both led by LeBron James -- have surpassed a plus-30 net rating in clutch situations.

[chart](http://i.imgur.com/jGniAXh.png)

While the 2012-13 Heat were able to pull off perhaps the most remarkable comeback in NBA history to win Game 6 of the NBA Finals en route to the title, Cleveland's clutch heroics didn't carry over to the playoffs. Despite James' winning 3 at the buzzer of Game 2, the 2008-09 Cavaliers were outscored in clutch situations during the Eastern Conference finals, losing two games by a single point and the series 4-2.

There's reason to believe Golden State's success might be more sustainable. After all, Warriors coach Steve Kerr has usually saved his best weapon -- the so-called ""death lineup,"" with Draymond Green at center along with Andre Iguodala, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Harrison Barnes -- primarily for clutch situations.

Of the 149 minutes that fivesome has played together in 2015-16, per NBA.com/Stats, 64 have come in the fourth quarter, the most of any Warriors lineup. And when the death lineup has played in the fourth quarter, it has outscored opponents by an unimaginable 73.4 points per 100 possessions.

Ordinarily, I believe that thin-slicing point differential against top opponents or in clutch situations is a mistake because it reduces sample sizes. However, when all the data lines up to confirm the dominance that's evident watching Golden State win 90 percent of its games, it's worth making an exception.

No matter what point differential and the power rankings derived from it might say, the Warriors -- and not the Spurs -- are the NBA's best team.",31,msaleem,/r/nba/comments/4c9qzc/spoiler_alert_nba_recap_32816_rise_of_the_raptors/d1g7r4x/,d1g7r4x,1459193463.0,1459164663.0,"[Spoiler Alert] NBA Recap: 3/28/16 - Rise of the Raptors, Time to burn down the Bulls, Spurs #1 in NBA Power Rankings?, LeBron James peeping on Lala Anthony, Full game and individual player highlights, new podcast episodes, original content, and more",104,4c9qzc

60,"Sigh, Woj. Thing is, he has a point, but it's kind of buried in there - Spo *is* the best coach LeBron has had, and if the Cavs end up playing the Heat, Spo's familiarity with James' game is going to matter. Specifically, the 2014 Basketball Deity Spurs beat the Heat not only by forcing LeBron into jumpshots, but by shutting down all the secondary threats and forcing LeBron into a one-man show. He had fantastic individual stats that series, and the Heat still lost 3 of those games before the end of the first quarter. Miami did something very similar to the Cavs last week - in a vacuum, LeBron actually had a great game (26/3/3/ in 3 quarters), but the Heat cut off passing lanes and shut down all of LeBron's drive and kick outlets. Miami has the length and quickness to make life hell for Cleveland's perimeter players, and Whiteside's massive frame negates some of Tristan Thompson's incredible offensive rebounding. It is a troubling matchup for the Cavs - I still think they would win in 6, but if Love or Irving put together a bad stretch of games, that could easily flip.",164,abiomusicologist,/r/nba/comments/4bwbox/wojnarowski_heat_without_bosh_still_formidable/d1czer8/,d1czer8,1458942341.0,1458913541.0,"[Wojnarowski] Heat, without Bosh, ""still formidable threat to humiliate LeBron in May""",486,4bwbox

>James' unfollowing of the Cavs was sort of a preamble, the source said. He's starting to pare down some of the ""noise"" without shutting off his account entirely.

>James didn't just unfollow @cavs – the official Twitter account of the team for which he's supposed to deliver a championship.

>He also unfollowed Allie Clifton, the team's sideline reporter for Fox Sports Ohio, with whom he's had a cordial, friendly, professional relationship for two seasons.

>James also unfollowed the Twitter account of Austin Carr, the Cavs' in-game analyst for Fox and a team legend, whom James admires. He parted ways with the account of ESPN Cavs reporter Dave McMenamin, and NBA reporter Chris Broussard, and Sports Illustrated'd Lee Jenkins. It was to Jenkins whom James dictated his essay announcing his return to Cleveland in the summer of 2014.

>In all, James unfollowed 14 accounts recently – he's down to 153 from 167. According to the source close to James, most were NBA media types and basketball-related accounts.

He is probably one of the hardest players in the league to defend and its not because of insane athleticism but because of his mind. I personally love watching him play, his mindgames on the court have me clapping when he draws a foul or blows by his defender or when he pulls up and drains a 3 cuz he was given too much space.",28,alex94xela,/r/nba/comments/49x3io/james_harden_is_currently_averaging_29_points_71/d0vsex1/,d0vsex1,1457715022.0,1457686222.0,"James Harden is currently averaging 29 points, 7.1 assists and 6.4 rebounds per game, putting him on pace to join Michael Jordan, LeBron James and Oscar Robertson as the only players to post a stat line of 29/7/6 for a single season.",372,49x3io

No one understands Irving’s importance more than James, team sources told The Vertical, which is why no one is working harder than James to get the two All-Stars on the same page.

Kyrie gotta take that extra step if the Cavs want to win a chip.

This also excludes the first 3 years of his career, in which he was 4-14 in these situations (and 1-2 in the playoffs). That ""10 seasons"" was chosen very intentionally to make this look worse.

The NBA as a whole is [51-250](http://bkref.com/tiny/KGWsF) on shots in this situation this season (20.4%). In LeBron's career he's 14.8% in the regular season  and 35.7% in the playoffs, 18.7% combined.

If we're willing to expand our scope a bit beyond just taking a shot under 5 seconds, here are LeBron's stats per 48 clutch minutes (under 5 mins to go, game within 5 points) from 82games.com:

And note that clutch time is when offensive efficiency goes down. The fact that LeBron can put up these numbers year in and year out in clutch time is staggering.  Check those links: every year, not only is he a top scorer, he's one of the top guys on the list in rebounds, assists, and shooting efficiency.

The first couple seasons on the list, from his first Cleveland stint, average to more than 60-15-10 per 48 clutch minutes on .660 TS%. Think about that for a second. That's like Wilt Chamberlain combined with Oscar Robertson, except at today's pace instead of the inflated pace of 50 years ago, at super-efficient rates. There's *probably* no known precedent for that level of dominance.

Edit: Other players may have seen similar clutch improvements, /u/pleasefeedthedino is right.

736,"Normally I avoid these men vs. women threads since they seem to invite pretty bigoted conversation.  But I'll give it a legitimate shot/analysis.  

Offensively, at the very least, the NBAers could simply shoot over the NCAAWers.  Breaking the press by passing over them shouldn't be too tough.  At that point, they'd be relying on passing into a post spot and having AD or Lebron shoot over them.  Length alone would accomplish this, but add in good vertical leaps and it'd be pretty dominating.

Defensively, it might be tough having 3 guys cover 5 women, but on arm span alone I think they'd be able to contest a lot of outside jumpers and block nearly all inside shots.  However, stamina concerns would crop up; I think they'd end up giving away a few uncontested jumpers/threes, so they'd have to answer offensively to be sure.

741,"I said this to a lot of people, but everyone wants to follow ""the eye test,"" which is straight up terrible.  People see what they want to see, and they want to see steals, blocks, and a guy husting on the court.  Those things are all great, but that doesn't mean anything if there aren't actually points prevented due to a player being on the floor.

I acrually hate the DRPM that OP uses, simply because it's the same stat that said Khris Middleton was the eighth best defender in the league last year and that Curry is the second best PG in the game at defense. It is supposed to isolate the player, but that's hard to do when players are put into units and sometimes paired with great defensive players, bringing their on court rating up.  I prefer to look at DBPM on B Ball Ref, and while it is far from perfect, it is a alittle more apparent in its calculation (ESPN crceated the DRPM and isn't clear on what they use as a calculation) and it seems to correlate more with those who have a rep for being great defenders.  For instance, Kawhi is somewhere in the rnage of +3.0 - 3.6, and up until this year, Paul George was between +1.8 - 2.9.  

The point of this ramble was to say that Lebron is STILL having a remarkable year by the DBPM standard, and we can look back on it historically to the years when Bird, Magic, and Jordan played:

Career DBPM:

-Hakeem: 3.8

-Bird: 2.5

-Robinson: 4.3

-Jordan: 1.1

-Pippen: 2.4

-Lebron: 1.9

-Duncan: 4.0

-Kawhi: 2.9

These are just some samples, but you can find them directly on the site.  As you can see, the stat lines up pretty well with who we think are really good defenders.  However, they also show, historically, why our perceptions are skewed by why someone is a good defender or not.  Jordan, for example, is low on the list; some is just because and the stats show that; unfortunately, he kept getting the first team defenses when he probably didn't deserve them later on.he wasn't a great defender past the first three peat, and some is due to the fact he was a guard.  The farther you are from the basket, the harder it is to be more efficient at protecting the rim.  However, what I noticed was the year he a high DBPM, Jordan won the DPOY (+2.3).  Jordan averaged a +0.6 to 2.7 his first year until the end of his first three peat.  He wasn't always very hoigh, but our perception was that he was a good defender early on, 

Conversely, Lebron started his first year, at 18, with a -0.2, which means he gave up more points than the average player when on the floor. Yet, he has never been in the negative since, and he even got as high as +3.6 one year, which is fucking incredible.  Last year, in the postseason, he averaged a +5.1 rating, which is remarkable.  The stats have shown Lebron HAS gotten better, and this year, he's at a +2.3, correlating with the opinion that he has been a very good defender.  The problem is that our perception was that he was a bad defender, and it stuck.

I don't mean to rub statistics in anyone's face, but it is clear the numbers back up the perception of Lebron as a great defender, and it correlates with our perceptions of a lot of great individuals player from the past and present, too. I just threw Jordan in there to show he actually DID diminish as he got older and how our opinion kept him high. Other things, like Skip Bayless, do a pretty good job of that, too.

The problem is Lebron doesn't have a high steal count or a ton of blocks, but he prevents points being put up when on the floor. Period.  We tend to look at high steal counts (Jordan) or intense effort (Wiggins) and believe they're automatically just great.  Just because a guy is trying hard, it doesn't mean he's good at it.  We confuse effort and results, and while it's not bad to applaud the effort, we shouldn't kid ourselves on the results.  Hell, how many people come on here and talk about Curry as a top flight defender because of steals?  I'm just saying the numbers are saying otherwise for Lebron, and we let our perceptions get in the way of understanding that the guy flat out KNOWS how to work a system from the defensive end as well as the offensive end.  That includes not gambling when not needed to get an extra steal, not sagging off your guy, not hiding in the low post while your guy is on the perimeter, and not getting caught in screens.  Respect the fact that the team is better with him on the floor and that he may be getting the job done better than most.",47,Taylor2639,/r/nba/comments/472w3y/lebron_james_has_been_very_quietly_having_a_great/d0a1zq4/,d0a1zq4,1456220468.0,1456191668.0,Lebron James has been very quietly having a great season on the defensive end.,485,472w3y

949,"My ~~hair brained~~ harebrained theory on LeBron and his bball IQ:

Let's assume he is indeed very smart, which is why he's so incredible at passing, has insane court vision and is so demanding of his teammates. He clearly has ideas for what they need to be doing and is constantly trying to set them up, so that's why we see him barking at teammates and probably why, if that was the case, Blatt had a hard time standing up to him. 

However! Like a lot of very, very smart people I know, I suspect LeBron doesn't have the ability to see himself entirely objectively, from an outsider's perspective, especially within the context of the offense. It's why we see him jack up ""fuck you"" threes continually despite the slump and why he's received criticism in the past for things like not driving to the basket enough: he needs someone to provide him with that perspective. 

Bosh and Love had similar careers before joining up with Lebron, so they might not apply. But one of the biggest differences between the Miami squads and the current Cavs is the difference in experience between Wade and Irving. Wade's veteran experience + high basketball IQ gave LeBron the opportunity to take a breath occasionally from being the engine of the offense. In a way, I liken the relationship between LeBron/Wade to MJ/Phil. I'm not saying Irving is dumb or not talented, he's just young. 

The smartest people sometimes have the hardest time seeing themselves objectively and critically, and I think that applies to LeBron. Now does that mean he's incapable of winning while being alone at the top of the mountain? Of course not, he's LeBron James. But I feel like that could partially explain a lot of the things we've seen LeBron do on the court as a player.
