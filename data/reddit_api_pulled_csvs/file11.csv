180,"I saw Kevin Durant at a grocery store in San Francisco yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.

He said, “I'm not Kevin Durant.”

I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and waiving his championship ring in front of my face. 

I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Ring Pops in his hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Mr. Durant, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be someone else, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the Ring Pops and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each Ring Pop and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by saying ""gorillas don't do that.""",82,AndThisGuyPeedOnIt,/r/nba/comments/77mya9/road_trippin_rj_channing_has_been_arguing_with/donmdhd/,donmdhd,1508563561.0,1508534761.0,[Road Trippin] RJ: “Channing has been arguing with fans on Snapchat a lot lately.” LeBron to Channing: “From your account?”,1127,77mya9

$18.9 mil this year. $21 mil in the last year of his contract.

Giannis makes $22.5M this year. His lowest year is more expensive than Kawhi's highest year.

And that's Giannis, who's already a young high ceiling stud on a bargain contract. But he's no 2-time DPOY, 2-time MVP finalist, Finals MVP.

And then there's Wiggins and Otto with $25+M this year. And my boy Harry Barnes with $23.1M.

An analogy. Assume there is only one unicorn in the world and that unicorn has a 50% chance of sprouting wings. Assume there are 500 million horses in the world, and each of those horses has a 25% chance of sprouting wings. Is it more likely the only unicorn sprouts wings or that one of the 500 million horses sprouts wings?

Also, since I'm being pedantic, the probability that he makes a future shot and/or makes a future finals is not equal to his past success at those things.

""One of the biggest aspects no one wants to talk about is the max contract the Cavs can offer him, and its way more complicated than just the extra a year and money the Cavs can offer by having his bird rights.

During the last CBA negotiations, CP3 and LeBron successfully made it so teams can offer full length max deals to players who will turn 38 by the end of the contract. It used to be 36 years old.

LeBron turns 33 this season, meaning if he signed a five year max, he would be 38 by the time it ends. Matches up perfectly. Chris Paul opted in and got himself traded to Houston so they would have his Bird Rights and could do the exact same thing for him.

Now many people would say LeBron doesn't need the extra money, he's basically a billionaire, and that's true. It's not about the money for LeBron and hasn't been since he opted out in 2014 and said he would only be taking the max. It's all about power and player empowerment. It seems LeBron learned a lot in his time in Miami about leverage and what teams will do and say to try and undercut a players negotiating power, and LeBron understands that him making concessions makes it more difficult for every present and future NBA player to negotiate for their full value if LeBron doesn't do it for himself.

This is why LeBron has been holding Gilbert's feet to the fire season after season. He's never going to get played like he did by Riley ever again and if he does it DAMN sure it won't be Dan Gilbert who plays him. He's gonna make him sweat over and over and over and finally when it comes time he will take the absolute largest contract in NBA history.""",836,A_A_lewis_,/r/nba/comments/72dwxr/lebron_james_said_intentions_to_finish_career_in/dnhq595/,dnhq595,1506388813.0,1506360013.0,LeBron James said intentions to finish career in Cleveland haven't changed,2155,72dwxr
