I don't think theres really ever been as complete of a player before. I think Simmons has compared him to a rich mans Bird, Lebron being more athletic.

Hes averaged around 28-8-8 for like 6 years on really good TS% (over 60 for most seasons). When talking about amazing all around players, when talking about a player who brings the most to a team in every facet of the game, hes gotta be top 5. 

If you are talking about best primes, he has to be up there. Obviously longevity has to be talked about but he already has a ton of individual accolades, but idk how many more titles he'll win. But he hasn't really suffered many big injuries so i imagine he has a ton left in him.

Wade also said he isn't surprised because [LeBron called some of the plays too in Miami](http://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-heat/fl-miami-heat-news-0402-20150401-story.html).

399,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""highly scrutinized.""  Jordan's greatness was certainly questioned during the years leading up to his first championship, with many people considering him a ball hog.  The Bulls considered him the greatest after his first threepeat, that's when the statue went up outside the new stadium.  Anyone who questioned that title had their questions answered by the second threepeat.

But there was still scrutiny of a different kind after the first threepeat and retirement, as Sam Smith published *The Jordan Rules,* revealing a side of Jordan not many people had seen.  There were revelations about his gambling, and the rumor spread that he had retired because of it.  Then when his father was killed, the rumor spread that it was because of MJ's gambling debts.  When he played baseball he was subjected to ridicule.  So there was a lot of scrutiny at that point.

Then of course he returned, and all was forgiven because everyone wanted to see him play again.  But he returned in the middle of a season and although he showed flashes of brilliance, he also was rusty and it showed.  Shaq and Penny's team beat the Bulls, and there were some who wondered if that was a sign of things to come.

Of course, the best answer to scrutiny is to keep winning, and that's exactly what Jordan did the next season, best team record in history, then two more rings after that.  Sheer winning can overcome scrutiny. 

Look at James, he was under his greatest scrutiny before he won a ring, under renewed scrutiny last year when he didn't win a ring, and will be under scrutiny this year if he doesn't win a ring.  But if you just keep winning rings?  All the scrutiny, at least the negative kind, tends to go away -- at least until you retire.",35,wjbc,/r/nba/comments/2yk2ed/at_what_point_of_his_career_was_michael_jordan/cpabjwa/,cpabjwa,1426030713.0,1426001913.0,At what point of his career was Michael Jordan widely considered the greatest of all time?

885,"Some good points brought up in the article (and comments):

On hand-checking:

> This is what Jordan faced every night. Nobody was quick enough to stay with him, so they clutched, grabbed and held to prevent him from getting to the basket. The Pistons started the practice, the Knicks continued it and countless other contenders copied it.
> 
> The hand-check gave a second life to so many slow perimeter players. Craig Ehlo would have been fried in this era unless he developed some lateral quickness, for example. But he ultimately was the man tasked with checking Jordan, and despite some memorable failures, he was better at it than most.

The prevalence of man defense in the 90s:

> But the simplicity was also due to the existing rules, which penalized teams for, essentially, playing zone. If you wanted to double-team a player, you had to double-team a player. There was no digging down, no helping off non-shooters to pre-rotate to stop the bigger scoring threat. It was double-team or nothing.
> 
> This made it especially easy to post up. Send your tallest man on the block, let him back down his single defender, and all he needs to do is pick out the teammate who the defense helped off to double-team. If no double-team, go to work. 

How that could be taken advantage of in the 90s:

> That had lasting implications. These days, coaches bench size in favor of speed and shooting. They accept defensive trade-offs because too many non-shooters makes it impossible to conduct a reasonable offense. In the 90s, though, teams had to actually defend every player on the court unless they sent a hard double-team. This allowed teams to play unskilled titans or defensive specialists who nevertheless had to be accounted for because the rules said so.
> 
> This occasionally was taken to the extreme. In the 1991 playoffs, Don Nelson would station his biggest player, whether it was journeyman Jim Petersen, youngster Tyrone Hill or the previously unknown Tom Tolbert, 30 feet from the hoop just to get David Robinson out of the lane. They weren't going to do anything productive from 15 feet, much less 30, but Robinson still had to come out and pretend like they could anyway. The Warriors posted up Mitch Richmond and Chris Mullin against smaller players, feasted on the driving lanes Tim Hardaway now had and upset the Spurs in four games.
> 
> In 2014, Robinson would have tiptoed the lane while essentially playing a one-man zone around the rim and Nelson would have been forced to choose between going small and getting lit up on the other end or leaving his big men in and suffering spacing consequences. In 1991, those centers were the unsung heroes by standing aimlessly well beyond the three-point line and doing nothing.
> 
> Place LeBron James in this world, and you can see how he'd be even more devastating. He'd have to fight harder to beat his own man, but once that happened, it wouldn't be hard to pick out open players. He averages nearly seven assists for his career; imagine how many he'd have if he could back someone down, draw a double-team and easily find the open man. Imagine how many points he'd get in the low post if he only had one man to beat each time. Jordan prolonged his career by learning how to back his man down and shoot over them when he realized no help was coming. The development of LeBron's post game would have come much faster if he didn't have to worry as much about reading that help.

Tradeoffs:

> So, which player would be better in the other's era? It's complicated. In real life, James would learn how to use his size and raw strength more effectively and Jordan would have learned how to rifle crosscourt passes to open three-point shooters while running the high pick-and-roll.
> 
> In this fantasy world? It's tough to say. Perhaps Jordan would have put up bigger numbers in the regular season against poor defenses, only to struggle against the quickness and length of tough, smart schemes in the playoffs. How would he fare against a team like the Pacers that would corral him in a mid-range pocket on a pick-and-roll? By contrast, perhaps LeBron would have averaged 13 assists a game, yet be stifled in the post by wider, slower defenders on teams that refused to double-team him. LeBron would not have enjoyed going up against Anthony Mason, that's for sure.

From the comments:

> How many SF’s in the 90’s could handle the size/speed combintion of Lebron in a 1 on 1 battle? Because that would make a huge difference. Anyone who questions Michael is automatically said to be blasphemous…and that simply isn’t true. Michael used his physical skill set to take advantage of the rules as they were back in his day. Lebron does the same here.
>> *Someone says no one could take on Karl Malone*
>>> LeBron and Malone have the exact same body type. So what is the issue here? You don’t think LeBron could deliver elbows to the face and smack people in the nuts like the Mailman en route to 27 points per game? You’re crying about him getting away with calls nowadays, he’d have unlimited freedom to harass players on defense. Go look at how MJ and Scottie guarded the perimeter, now imagine someone who is Pippen’s height except he’s even stronger and quicker.
> 
>>> Great players adapt to the circumstances around them. James used to be a crappy outside shooter now you can’t sag off, Jordan used to rely solely on attacking the rim before developing a post game. If you seriously think LeBron James couldn’t succeed in the 90s you might as well not even watch basketball anymore since that suggests the talent drop off has been catastrophic.
