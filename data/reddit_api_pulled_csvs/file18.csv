74,"I always have a little love for Stevenson, Central Valley represent üòû. 

He's easily the best player I've ever gone against, there was drama surrounding whether he would go pro or not, but we all knew. When people ask me what makes a player so good, I use him as an example. He was fast, could shoot alright, and was strong... but so are folks at the rec. What made him completely unguardable was his ability to change speed and his vertical explosiveness. He could start, stop, start, all at different speeds and at will. When you thought he was going fast, he would make a move and take off in a faster gear, absolutely nuts. His ability to rise was even scarier, he could be flat footed and next thing you know he's at the rim and back down before you could blink. I legitimately remember going for a rebound *already* on my way up and I see him still on the ground, I turn attention back to secure the ball and he already matched my peak, has the ball, and back down and running by the time I hit the ground. Stupid. 

He was only an average NBA player, I can't imagine playing against an elite NBA player at that level.

Amid ongoing tense relations between the population and the soldiers, a mob formed around a British sentry, who was subjected to verbal abuse and harassment. He was eventually supported by eight additional soldiers, who were subjected to verbal threats and snowballs.

The delusional views your own players, the persecution complex when anything is viewed negatively about your team, the excessive pettiness / saltiness when they lose, etc. The tweet asking Boston fans to chant baby at LeBron is a perfect example of it going too far.

I feel like this side of Bill was kept in check at ESPN by their editors and ever since then it's become a bigger part of his work. He used to write like a sports analyst with some Boston favoritism and now it's more of a Boston analyst with clickbait hot takes regarding other teams/players.

Michael Jordan retired with ""only"" 48,485 minutes played, so LeBron already has a full season more than Jordan on the odometer. Bill Russel retired with 48,223 minutes played.

Dwyane Wade is currently only at 38,904 minutes played and Melo is at 37,913. 

LeBron has played the equivalent of **3.7 regular seasons** more than Dwyane Wade who is in his same draft class.

My theory has always been that Jordan could have played 10 more years if he accepted a much smaller role, but his ego prevented that and he still wanted to be a 30 ppg guy at age 39/40.

But LeBron could potentially overcome that ego and accept a role similar to Vince Carter, just being that grizzly vet on a championship quality team who can come in and tear things up for 15-20 minutes all the way up to age 60.

696,"the whole GOAT argument is stupid. I have seen MJ play, and Kobe, and LeBron. To think that stats or championships will make you the GOAT is stupid. It's a transferable label that will keep changing hands with each new generation.

MJ was also competitive as heck. A true test of greatness would be if these guys played head to head in their primes. MJ played a different game. When he played shooting 10 - 15 3s was unheard of. Does that mean that MJ wasn't skilled enough to 10-15 3s game after game? No. Because if that was the game he had to play, then that's the game he would've trained himself for, and probably still won.

For instance this year East playoff teams have a 52% ooc win rate. West playoff teams have a 65% ooc win rate. 

Stats always need context. Even if it's just the eye test. But if you redid ooc win rate for these playoff teams I'd bet it would be pretty telling.

779,"Don't wanna ruffle feathers, I know how a lot of people here feel. But could you make an argument for Kobe being the best player in the 2010 playoffs? He had a decent season but he really turned it up by game ~~5~~6 of the first round and was dominating until basically the end of the season (up until game 7 of the finals) 


**Edit:** To add some context to my argument


Kobe's numbers in the 2010 Playoffs:

*29.2/6.0/5.5/1.3/0.7 while shooting .458/.374/.842 in 40.1 mpg (23 total games)*


From Game 6 of Round 1 to Game 6 of the NBA Finals:


*31.7/6.2/5.9/1.3/0.9 while shooting .487/.396/.886 in 40.8 mpg (17 games)*


The reason I chose game 6 of the first round is because I believe he got his knee drained before game 6. It was a semi-major talking point during those playoffs, especially because he had 11/12 games with 30+ points following that.

Another point: Kobe shot terribly during game 7, but he also had 15 boards, got to the line 15 times and I believe had around 10 points in the fourth quarter. Not defending his poor shooting/shot selection, but he did make some big plays/shots in the fourth to help us win that game, not to mention getting us there in the first place.",98,,/r/nba/comments/6a072q/chris_broussard_lebron_james_is_the_first_player/dhaoi76/,dhaoi76,1494299676.0,1494270876.0,"Chris Broussard: ""LeBron James is the first player ever in his 14th year to be the best player in the world.""",261,6a072q

799,"It takes a rare type of player to be able to defend Lebron well. Boris Diaw did one of the best jobs I've seen someone do against Lebron a few years ago:

>Diaw has never been depicted as an incapable defender‚Äîmore like lazy. Someone with his versatile skill set is actually able to effectively defend all five positions when the work ethic is there. And in Game 5, the assiduity was certainly there.

>Per Kurt Heilin of NBC Sports' ProBasketBallTalk, LeBron shot just 1-of-8 from the floor when guarded by Diaw, or 12.5 percent.

>‚ÄúBoris is a pretty good defender,‚Äù Tony Parker said after the game, according to Heilin. ‚ÄúHe looks awkward, but he gets the job done. Every time in Europe he guards guys like that, the Kirilenkos, stuff like that, the fours who can‚Äôt really move.""

I was a freshman in high school when LeBron was a junior. One Friday during ninth period English, a bunch of kids were talking about how Jared Villars was throwing a party and LeBron would be there. Jared had been a state champion wrestler for my high school, but this whole video tape scandal with kids drinking and doing drugs on tape got him suspended from the team. So he transferred to St Vincent St Mary's, only 20 min away. Being a dope athlete was enough to make him cool with LeBron. 

My friend looked at me and asked if I thought I'd go. My response was along the lines of, ""Why? I'm sure this kid will make it to the NBA but it's not like he'll actually be a superstar or anything.""

Some of the players able to challenge Lebron:

Dirk. Too old, I'll take porzingis

Dwight Howard. Can't compete anymore, so I'll go for the next best player from that team... Courtney lee.

Derrick rose. If he can play like MVP DRose, then he can at least challenge Lebron for MVP and bragging rights.

Tim Duncan. He's retired, so the next best option would obviously be melo. Get someone super chill. Get one of his friends to mess with his head

Kevin Garnett. Also retired, so well go with another classic trash talking big: joakim Noah. We all know how attached Lebron is to Cleveland, so it will be good to have someone constantly insulting Cleveland to get in Lebron's head.

So I guess my team would be:
DRose
Courtney Lee

987,"The 2012-2013 Pacers had a pretty good idea. 

On defense, get an elite rim protector and an elite wing defender with the size to match up against lebron.

On offense, get a PG who can score (Lebron can be an elite defender but he has less of an effect on PG scoring), and a bench that can get buckets when Lebron is out of the game. 

That kind of describes the Thibodeau Bulls as well, with Butler/Noah on defense and Rose on offense. Injuries robbed us of a potentially great matchup. 

The Raptors don't really fit this model. They don't have the rim protection, and Tucker is the only dude in that group with size/speed to **maybe** keep up with Lebron. They have the offense on paper, but Lowry and Derozan have been waaaaaay too inconsistent to keep up their end of the bargain.

Currently active teams that have the weapons to do it: GSW and Utah. You could make a case for the Grizzlies (idk if Tony Allen has the size) and for OKC (if Roberson could stay on the floor and the bench wasn't an absolute mess). If Justise Winslow turned into an all-world defender, Miami might be able to piece it together with whiteside and dragic. Can't think of anyone else off the top of my head.
