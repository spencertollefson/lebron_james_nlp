To me, LeBron's personal life and off the court personality and behaviour makes him a great role model.  He knows what to say, hangs out around a good people, a dedicated father from what I see, he's been with his girlfriend for about twelve years and never once heard anything about their relationship.  Girls probably throw themselves at LeBron and other superstars, some players won't have that control over their ""urges"" (Ex: Kobe...still one of my favourite players), but LeBron seems to be able to just focus on basketball and his family...also making business with Warren Buffet and Bill Gates.  If beautiful girls came at me, I probably couldnt be like LeBron.

On the other hand, his girlfriend Savannah is probably a great lady, being able to trust LeBron and make LeBron want to be with only her.  There are always two in a relationship and both of them seem to be on the path everyone dream of (relationship wise).

LeBron has had a great career and is continuing his greatness on and off the court.

157,"I'm not going to make a case for who is better but I do have some advice for NBA fans:

Pretend that Lebron is the GOAT. Just do it. It doesn't hurt you at all to pretend even if you still think MJ or Wilt is better. Just pretend Lebron is the best basketball player ever because it makes watching him **magical**. If you pretend he's the GOAT, you feel like you are watching history being written. You feel like you are experiencing something live that no human will ever experience again once Lebron retires. Every fastbreak dunk, every chasedown block, every alley oop, every half court 3, every cross over, every 30-8-7 game, every ridiculous circus shot, every WTF dominating playoff game, every championship he'll win: you are witnessing a fucking legend in his prime. You are watching a basketball God play at the peak of his craft. To let yourself second guess every magical thing he does every night he plays is doing yourself a huge disservice. Imagine people who lived through Jordan's time hating/doubting everything he did. People saying he'll never be better than Russell, or Wilt, people who--instead of soaking in the experience of watching the GOAT play--instead make up arguments for why he won't be the GOAT. People who bring up Russell's rings every time MJ wins a championship. People who pick apart his poor 3-pt shooting. People who laugh at him for needing a Scottie Pippen to win championships. People who dismiss his legacy before he even finishes his career.

Don't do this to yourself. Be awed by Lebron. Be inspired. Be flabbergasted. Every time he's on the floor, let yourself have the thoughts you want to have. Let yourself pity the other team Lebron is playing. Let yourself laugh at the players who have to guard him. Let yourself say to yourself: I'm watching God's gift to basketball fans.

There were so many Lebron haters on this subreddit after he left Cleavland. Even before he won the ring, I always wondered how basketball fans can let some ESPN manufactured BS ruin their enjoyment of Lebron. To make them call him Lebrick, call him Robin to Wade's Batman, to let them think Lebron melts in the 4th quarter, to CHEER when Lebron fails. Think about what those haters missed out on! Now they've bandwagoned but they still try to be cute by dismissing any GOAT talks and downplaying Lebron's every achievement whenever MJ's name is mentioned.

Look: Lebron is currently habitually doing things that MJ could never dream of doing in his prime. Enjoy it. People saying wait till his career is over before thinking about GOAT talks, sure you can do that, but what's the point? Lebron will be long retired and you'll never see him play live again. You'll never experience that feeling of CURRENTLY watching the GOAT play. Of knowing you are experiencing the pinnacle of basketball. You can wait till the dust settles, and count his rings if you want, but why not just pretend he's the GOAT so you can truly appreciate Lebron's craft live? Imagine going back in time to watch Jordan during his prime and having the benefit of knowing what we all know now. How much more would you enjoy watching him play? It took Jordan a looooong time to win his first ring, and people loved hating on him for the same reason people hate on Lebron now. They waited till after Jordan was long past his prime and done winning rings before they realized what they missed out on. Don't do that to yourselves now.",122,JustMadeYouYawn,/r/nba/comments/195v74/stan_van_gundy_says_lebron_is_better_than_mj/c8l4igc/,c8l4igc,1361790610.0,1361761810.0,Stan Van Gundy says Lebron is better than MJ,26,195v74

He also guaranteed CLE would get a lot of young talent with his departure because they would also be a lottery team. So CLE is now stacked with young talent and will be flush with cap space to sign LeBron Kyrie and one more star along with their young talent from picks.

Does anyone actually disagree with this?  Isn't success -- not who is the better player, but who is more successful -- all about championships?  And yes, that does mean Russell was more successful than Jordan, absolutely.  Maybe not Horry, because it is not fair to compare role players to stars, but certainly Russell.

Sheesh, I just feel like people love piling on Jordan these days.  Yes, he can be a jerk, but don't buy into the media hype.

Edit: I hope everyone watched Inside the NBA tonight.  Chuck picked James if he wins six championships like Jordan.  Kenny picked Kobe because there is a proven record there, not just potential.  Shaq picked Kobe because he has those five championships and that's how players are measured.

253,"I see a lot of this ""GOAT"" talk, but I'm not even sure people agree on what that even means. When we say ""GOAT"", there are two meanings to it: greatest CAREER of all time and greatest PLAYER of all time. 

Jordan had what almost everyone considers the greatest career of all time -- individual accomplishments, lots of awards, lots of rings. That's hard to beat. No one could seriously try to assert that Lebron right now has had a better career than Jordan.

But in terms of simply being a ""damn good basketball player"", I think it is indeed arguable that Lebron might be one of THE greatest players to play the game. Sure as hell doesn't mean his career has been storybook or that his legacy is cemented, but in terms of what he does on the basketball court I don't have a problem with people saying he may be, along with Jordan, one of the greatest ever. It's kind of like with Shaq -- not many consider him to be the greatest of all time in terms of overall career, but in terms of being one hell of a dominant player, he is among the very best ever.

I think some people confuse the two ideas and that makes ""GOAT"" claims sound ridiculous depending on what your stance is on what that term means. It's downright silly to say that Lebron has had a better NBA career and legacy than Jordan and at this point it shouldn't really even be discussed. But in terms of simply being a great -- and maybe one of the greatest -- basketball players ever, I think that's fair to discuss. 

More simply stated: What Lebron DOES on the court compared to MJ, we can have a meaningful discussion about. What Lebron HAS DONE on the court compared to MJ is a pointless argument at this moment.",55,theblackhole25,/r/nba/comments/18ggzg/why_lebron_is_and_isnt_jordan/c8eq5s1/,c8eq5s1,1360822568.0,1360793768.0,Why LeBron is and isn't Jordan,156,18ggzg

His game used to be about spreading the floor and going iso from the top of the key and finishing against 3 defenders in the paint.

437,"Absolutely terrible reporting. They're **maintaining cap flexibility**, not for LeBron, but for whatever they can use it for. One of the ideas behind the Oklahoma City model is that there's **no reason to spend cap space if you're not competing for a playoff spot.** It's a waste that does nothing but hurt your chances of re-signing your players. The Cavs found this out when they hamstrung themselves by giving Larry Hughes a big deal early when LeBron was here.

They're not like the Knicks, clearing cap for LeBron. They're just not spending money on free agents when they know all that will do is hold up cap room which they can use to take on salary in trades or give their players new deals. You're going to hear the Cavs name in just about every trade for a big player because they have the cap space to help get teams under the luxury tax, and this allows them to take in more picks. The last two years, taking in salary in trades got them Kyrie Irving and Tyler Zeller. 

This is so speculative and unfounded. ""Executives and agents around the league."" Translation: 2 or 3 guys. Bullshit.

Iverson made his run as pretty much the smallest player in the league. All of the series he went through were really close - I think all of them went to 7 (or 5) games. He completely put everything on the court. 

The thing that really puts Iverson's run on top is that he had a legendary game against Lakers, who were steamrolling the league. They were on a 19 game win streak, including going undefeated in the west playoffs against some of the best teams of the era - the Blazers, Kings, and Spurs. His 48 points in game 1 was one of the few times I've seen Kobe be handedly outplayed by another guard, and was the only loss for the nearly perfect Lakers playoff run in 2001.

Lebron's run to the Finals was amazing, especially the Detroit series. But, people forget that Ben Wallace left the Pistons the year before, and Larry Brown left 2 years before. This wasn't the same Pistons team of 2004-2006, this was a team that signed an aging Chris Webber as their starting center as a hope to save the season.

As much as I hate the Lakers and especially Kobe I've got to respect this aspect of his game.  He's extremely adaptable and he's someone who can spot up, post, bang a little inside, take you off the dribble, dominate in iso, draw a double and dish-out...  It's like pick your poison with him and saying ""he's not that good"" is the type of shit I'd expect Bayless or Smith to say, not Kenny.

560,"I feel like the retrospects I've read about LeBron have all been true. He's always been my favorite player and thus I have always defended him through a lot of the thick stuff, but looking back, it's just so obvious how much he's changed for the better.

I almost hesitate to say this, but I'm kind of glad (obviously, in retrospect) that he lost in 2011 despite being his #1 fan. He's never been a bad guy, I should stress that... but the days of LeBron farting loudly at a photoshoot have been tempered down to just normal joking/fun (as that ex-Cavs assistant said, he cut out all the bullshit after 2011), and a clear shift from being a boy-man with a man's wisdom underneath, to a man with a kid's heart underneath.

Compare LeBron at age 18 to LeBron at age 27 going on 28. Listen to interviews with him. Hell, even in the article, they make mention of how much he kind of relished attention. I can't blame him - dude was 16/17 when people started calling him the Chosen One, but he kind of accepted it. The coolest thing to me is getting back to that boy-man of old, to the man-boy that he is now. He's still the same, but he's better. That's what it is. He has always accepted his status as the ""Chosen One"". He very, very easily could've gloated to the media after winning his ring. Not a damn peep about that. That's because he knows what being 'LeBron James' means. He's probably one of the smartest athletes I've seen, if not the smartest. I think the inflection point for his development was the 2011 Finals. If he won it, i'm not so sure he'd be this LeBron James. I think he would've partly validated his boy-man priorities instead of his shift to a man-boy in 2012.

588,"Awesome video... I love how I can trace back my memory to each one of Lebron's milestones in his timeline (from the televising of the HS game on espn2/Hummer fiasco) to where I was at the the time watching the live broadcasts of these PTI episodes. 

Some things in retrospect:

* I love the budding rivalry  between Melo and Lebron in yesteryear that has obviously played in Bron's favor (Similar to Emeka Okafor and Dwight Howard)

* Passing to Pavlovic was the correct basketball play and it is ridiculous how Lebron was lambasted for it. (coming from a Kobe apologist) 

* The similarities in careers of MJ and LBJ are there 

* 2007-2009 is my favorite Bron (in terms of sheer ability)

* The guy just attracts attention no matter what he does (from HS-Miami) and has had ridiculous expectations externally set for him

I'm excited to watch the second half of this man's career. I think we're extremely lucky as a fanbase to watch some of the greatest legends in the sport in unique positions at their primes (Shaq, Duncan, Kobe, Lebron) within the last 10 years. I love this game.

623,"Reddit user ""lakerswiz"" had a good take on the current Lakers situation. To summarize it (and hopefully not drastically changing his words), there has to be some accountability on the part of the players. They're the ones missing shots in the paint and rotating poorly on defense. The coach is responsible for setting an offensive and defensive plan in place. Where should the blame go if the players cannot efficiently execute those plans? And then we go to the counter-argument that these said plans are absolute shit. It seems like the offense hasn't been overly atrocious and it's just a matter of missing a lot of free throws, Pau missing his great mid-range shots, and Kobe having to bail out his teams in tough situations over and over. 

Also, it's really difficult to compare one team's chemistry and make-up to another. It's not like Legos where you can just put it together if you have all the pieces. Let's wait to see how this team gels with a healthy Nash and at least 30+ games played as a unit.

696,"Any time I see a thread about Bird I feel like I should pop in and clear up some misconceptions.

First, that his defense was somehow not good. No, he wasn't the guy you wanted guarding a guard or an athletic small forward. But he was an elite defensive presence, leading the league 4 times in defensive win shares and standing at #63 all time in defensive rating. He offered tremendous help defense and post defense alongside elite rebounding. I mean, ask yourself: would Tim Duncan be able to guard that athletic small forward or that guard one-on-one? No? So is Tim Duncan an inferior defender?

Second, that he was just a shooter. His post game was fantastic and he could score from literally anywhere on the floor. Was he going to slam home a rim-rocking dunk over a defender? No. But he'd slither in and either kick the ball to a teammate for an easy look or find a weird angle and lay it in himself. The guy was a 40/50/90 shooter, and he did a lot more than just take jump shots. One thing a lot of folks probably don't realize is that the average NBA team took far fewer 3 point shots in Bird's era than they do today. So one of his greatest strengths was underutilized, and often the 3's he did take were difficult and in last-second situations. Put him in a modern NBA situation and he'll be draining much better looks, improving his 3P%, his true shooting %, and probably his point totals.

The last thing I think most people fail to recognize is the level of competition Bird had to deal with in comparison to a lot of the guys we like to compare him to. The 1980's East was probably the strongest conference basketball has ever seen. Certainly much stronger than anything Magic had to contend with out west. Stronger than anything Jordan had to contend with. And when Bird managed to make it past say the 76ers in the early 80's or the Pistons in the late 80's, he'd then have to clash with the Showtime Lakers most of the time.

The guy followed up 3 consecutive MVPS (with 2 Finals MVPs) by having two 40/50/90 seasons with stat lines like 30/9/6 and 28/9/7.6. And then he hurt his back.

And those stat lines become all the more impressive when you realize how little the man actually cared about personal stats. He was once a steal away from the second quadruple double in NBA history but *sat out the entire fourth quarter* because the game was a blowout.

This is a man who only cared about making the right play. Who knew how to lead a team and make his teammates better. Who was more reliable in the fourth quarter than perhaps any other player in the history of basketball.

724,"Ok sports fans, LeBron did not have the best supporting cast in Cleveland. Even I can admit that. But the Cavs were built to compliment LeBron. At its most basic, that meant people who could spread the floor. The only reliable to very good 3 point shooter on the Bobcats right now is Ben Gordon. As for the Cavs, they had (let's go with 2008-2010, the Cavs' two 60 win seasons) Mo Williams, Anthony Parker, Delonte West, Boobie Gibson, Antawn Jamison, and Wally Szczerbiak. On top of that the Cavs had Zydrunas Ilgauskus, who as I recall, played the pick and pop pretty well with Bron. Beyond people who could hit open jumpers, the Cavs were also a well-seasoned veteran team composed of good role-players, while the Bobcats are young as hell with only Sessions and Gordon as players who are good now (MKG will probably be awesome soon, while Biyombo and Walker have potential).

On top of that, you have to look at the coaches. I know Mike Brown is not popular around here, but he is one of the best defensive coaches in the league. His schemes with the Cavs were incredible. 2009-2010 they finished first in defensive efficiency, that's with only LeBron getting any all-nba defense considerations. In 2008-2010 they finished eighth, which is pretty good considering they had defensive sieves in Mo, Jamison, and Shaq. Now maybe Mike Dunlap will surpass Red Auerbach and Phil Jackson as the G.C.O.A.T, but it's not going to happen next season. He's a new NBA coach with a young team, never a pretty combinations. 

So I do agree with everyone saying LeBron could get them to the playoffs, but to people saying ""look what he did with the scrubs on the Cavs hurr-hurr"" you are simplifying things waaaay too much.",23,JohnnyZombie,/r/nba/comments/z580o/okay_guys_say_lebron_was_on_the_bobcats_do_you/c61llle/,c61llle,1346471102.0,1346442302.0,"Okay guys say LeBron was on the Bobcats, do you think he could take them to the ECF?

752,"It's hilarious how every single media out there suddenly acknowledges his greatness. Although he gets better every year, he's playing on this level for years now. It's just a joke how he went from ''backing down'', ''not clutch'' or ''still ringless'' to ''most dominant force'', ''most versatile player'', ''biggest facilitator'', ''closer'', ''big time player'' and so on.   

He's all of this since years. Not just one season, or since he's in Miami. It's a shame how US medias can only jump from storyline to storyline and not be only a tiny little bit objective about what they're talking. I know that they seek for audience and that it's the easiest way to get even the dumbest consumer out there, but come on, that 180° is a joke. That ring doesn't make his play one inch better than it was before, but he suddendly wen't from bust to *the guy who could possibly push MJ off the trone, in 3-4 years or so*.

800,">In Beijing, Krzyzewski divided leadership roles. He put James, with his deep, booming voice, in charge of the defense. James shouted out pick-and-rolls, called switches and broke down film. He knew what sets each opposing team would run — knew all of them.

>That carried over to Team USA’s preparation for the London Games. James often played center, guarded forwards and pressured guards. Where in 2008 he expressed his thoughts mostly about defense, this year he began to speak up in offensive meetings, in team meetings and at walk-throughs.

>Before the United States played Argentina in an exhibition Sunday, James suggested how to defend forward Luis Scola, and his scouting report proved invaluable in a 6-point victory.

>“One of the things detractors say is, ‘He got so much attention before he earned it,’ ” said Krzyzewski, who has said this will probably be his last Olympics as national team coach. “Well, it’s not his fault. He did get a lot of attention. But he’s earned this. He’s grown so much as a player going into this pivotal time of when you become, like for him, legendary.”

870,">Garnett and Pierce loved pushing his buttons more than anyone. During their final regular-season road trip to Miami, which turned out to be a surprisingly easy win for the Celtics, they spent the last two minutes busting Wade's balls about LeBron. You picked the wrong guy. You'll never win with that guy. LeBron could hear everything. They didn't care. In Game 5 of their playoff series, Garnett and Pierce pushed things a little further, believing that LeBron was ready to cave again. Down the stretch, Garnett muttered derisive obscenities under his breath anytime LeBron was in earshot, then stuffed him at the rim on a pivotal drive. A little bit later, Pierce nailed a back-breaking 3 right in LeBron's mug, then yelled, ""I have the balls to take that!"" as he trotted back down the floor.

>In retrospect, they pushed him too far. The Celtics regarded LeBron with such disdain — that's why Rondo angrily yelped, ""Let's go!"" before defending LeBron's final drive of regulation in Game 2. LeBron ended up settling for a 21-footer against someone seven inches shorter than him, followed by Rondo strutting back to the huddle and probably telling his teammates, ""I knew he didn't have the balls to come at me."" They spent that whole series challenging his manhood; by the end of Game 5, they thought they had broken him.
