15,"I remember all of the talk surrounding Lebron when he was still in high school.  People were absolutely going **crazy** over him, even though he was still a senior in high school!

I remember sportscasters (in totally unrelated NBA regular season games) interrupting the game to talk about LBJ, saying that Lebron was probably *already* a better player than about ten to fifteen percent of the league, and he hadn't even graduated from high school yet.

The point I'm making is, yeah, there's some hype about Wiggins, but the hype over Wiggins is **nothing** compared to the hype that was surrounding Lebron.

As far as what he did better than everyone else... Let me tell you this.  I thought the media was full of shit.  I thought the hype was ridiculous, and I couldn't understand why everyone was ready to crown this kid the king when he hadn't done jack shit on a professional level.  So, I wanted to see him for myself.  So, I watched him in the high school All American game on TV.  By the end of the game, I understood why he was so hyped.  He was incredible.  It was just totally obvious when you watched him that he was going to be not only an incredible player, but it was actually obvious that he was going to end up being one of the best to ever play the game.

I've been watching the NBA for almost thirty years now, and there have only ever been two players who, the very first time I saw them play, I thought to myself, fuck, that guy is going to be a legend.  Lebron was one of them, and MJ was the other.  They would just dribble the ball, and you could just... *tell* they were going to be legends.  It's hard to quantify that quality, but, you know it when you see it.

Wiggins may or may not end up being a top superstar in the NBA, but one thing I can flat-out guarantee you with 100 percent certainty is this; Wiggins is not as talented as Lebron.  He's just not.",177,toldyaso,/r/nba/comments/1y7eoq/what_made_lebron_a_sure_thing_coming_out_of_high/cfi1enj/,cfi1enj,1392724110.0,1392695310.0,What made LeBron a sure thing coming out of High School?,165,1y7eoq

184,"Jordan missed almost a whole season at the beginning of his career with a broken foot.  After that he hired Tim Grover to help him avoid future injury, and in the process gained a substantial amount of muscle.  But Grover also had him build up muscle in areas that aren't so visible, like his joints.  And, for Jordan, it worked.  

However, there's also a substantial amount of luck involved.  Some great players have had their careers shortened by what seem like freak injuries.  

Scottie Pippen was also a client of Grover's, but eventually had to have back surgery that hurt his play and shortened his career.  On the other hand, Pippen also didn't take a year and a half off in the middle of his career.",77,wjbc,/r/nba/comments/1xb8f3/why_did_jordan_never_seem_to_get_hurt_what_about/cf9rrdl/,cf9rrdl,1391843265.0,1391814465.0,Why did Jordan never seem to get hurt? What about Lebron?,31,1xb8f3
185,"For Lebron there are a number of reasons:

1. He is explosive, but only runs in straight lines. How many times do you see him juking, switching directions, doing killer crossovers? Almost never.  On fast breaks, he doesn't Eurostep or anything like that -- he just finds the seams and plows through with his strength. The juking and changing directions are what really puts you in danger for tears and sprains.
2. In the half-court setting, he picks his spots very VERY carefully. He almost never does wild drives into the teeth of the defense. When he sees an opening, he penetrates hard. But if it's not there, he does NOT force the issue. Unlike other players, he doesn't have to -- his passing and court vision are so good that he can almost always find a better play (i.e. a pass) than wildly forcing it. It's easy to see that less forcing of the issue around multiple defenders will generally mean less contact and less unpredictable injuries. Lebron ALWAYS plays in a very controlled, deliberate manner. He is never reckless.
3. Defenders are scared of his speed and power, so they are more reluctant to challenge him on the fastbreak and on hard drives to the rim. If they see him coming full speed, defenders are less likely to try for the block/charge or to get in his way (this is one reason, along with #2 above, why his FT attempts are less these days than past years). This leads to less collisions, less tangled-up limbs, less landing on other players' feet, etc.
4. This isn't necessarily a good thing, but Lebron knows when he's beat. If he's not in a GOOD position to make a defensive play, he won't really try too hard. This leads to less fouls (one of the main reasons he fouls so little), and also less fatigue and less contact overall.
5. His body is just built to take a beating. Not very scientific, yeah, but he's just so strong (his core, especially, which is the most important thing in basketball) and it's obvious he takes his training and conditioning seriously. His body is just well taken care of and well-balanced.
6. He's just lucky. Sometimes it really does just come down to that.",35,theblackhole25,/r/nba/comments/1xb8f3/why_did_jordan_never_seem_to_get_hurt_what_about/cf9w18l/,cf9w18l,1391854531.0,1391825731.0,Why did Jordan never seem to get hurt? What about Lebron?,31,1xb8f3

Jabari Parker was also very highly touted and was even on the cover of Sports Illustrated if I'm not mistaken.

Heck, I'm sure a lot of people knew who Embiid before the season but it wasn't until his recent 7 games or so where he was being ranked on big board's as the number one player.

The hype Wiggins was receiving only set him up to be a disappointment in the eye of the casual fan.

465,"From this article: http://insider.espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/10291123/nba-lebron-james-taking-easy

Some excerpts:

....

James sometimes wonders what would happen if he took as many shots as Durant does.
""I do get jealous, I'm not gonna lie,"" James said. ""I get jealous sometimes when I look over at KD and he's like 16-for-32 and then 14-for-34. ... Man.""

But that might require a different approach.

""First of all, you have to have an unbelievable mindset to get up 30 shots,"" James said. ""I always think about it, though. If I get up high-20s, 30 shots a game, what could I do today, with the way I'm playing?""

It's a question many basketball observers have asked, too. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra has said that if James was focused on scoring, he could ""realistically"" average 37 points per game.

But it's not as simple as ""shoot more, win more."" The Heat are 8-2 in James' 10 highest-usage games this season and 9-1 in his 10 lowest-usage games.

""I'm not much of a forced-shot guy,"" James said. ""But there are games where I have it going, and then at the end of the game, I'm like, damn, I shot just 12-for-16? Why don't I get up at least six or seven more? I definitely notice it.""

But the Heat's pace-and-space offense thrives on James' rare ability to create for himself and for others. The thinking is that Miami, which owns the second-most efficient offense in the land, has found a healthy equilibrium in which teams can't load up on James for fear that he'll hit the open teammate. As soon as he starts putting on the blinders, it might force an identity crisis for himself and his team.

""I think part of it is our offense,"" James said of his low shot total. ""It puts us all in an equal-opportunity situation.""

This is true, but the offense is also largely the same one that saw him shoot far more (18.1 field goal attempts) just two seasons ago.

Ultimately, though, James might not be that type of player anymore.

""I don't think it's part of my DNA,"" James says before cracking a smile. ""But I think if my teammates came to me and said, 'Listen. Tonight, go off, let's see what you can do.' I think I could do it then.""

......

And it's not just the on-court/off-court numbers, either. James is currently blocking 0.3 shots per 36 minutes. That's less than half his career rate. Same as Kyle Korver, Stephen Curry and Matt Bonner. Fewer per minute than Kyrie Irving, Mo Williams and John Wall.

""I haven't gotten many chase-down blocks this year,"" James says. ""Guys aren't challenging me as much. I mean, I've had a couple guys turn around and actually dribble the ball out.""

......

""I cannot coast,"" James said, ""because I don't know if the next game will be the last game I've ever played. It's my mindset, when I get out on the floor, I gotta go hard. I don't know where it came from, the way I was brought up, the way I played when I was a kid.""

To be clear, James even in second gear is better than just about every player in the game. His 29.3 player efficiency rating is still second in the league behind Durant, even if it's down from last season's league-leading 31.7 rate. By every measure, James remains a dominant force overall -- even if this Heat season feels like an 82-game preseason.

But James' numbers do speak volumes.

""I'm listening to the numbers. Even though I'm not a big numbers guy, I do my part,"" James said. ""Maybe I do have to start ramping it up a little but more.""

With two days off this weekend and a refreshing visit to the White House on Tuesday, James promises we'll see a different James against the 17-19 Washington Wizards.

*Is the Heat star going easy during this stretch of the long 82-game slog?*

By Tom Haberstroh | ESPN Insider

***

LeBron James is having an amazing 2013-14 season by any reasonable standard.

Except for his own.

James has somehow managed to raise his field goal percentage for the seventh straight season, to 59.1 percent. His true shooting percentage -- an advanced shooting percentage that incorporates 3-point shots and free throws – stands at 67.2 percent. How high is that? As pointed out in a BIG Number episode last month, we've never seen a true shooting percentage north of 67 percent while taking at least 15 field goal attempts per game.

But the conversation around James has been more accusatory than congratulatory. The big question isn't ""How's LeBron doing this?"" It's, ""Is LeBron coasting?""

Despite his otherworldly shooting efficiency, there is actually gobs of evidence to suggest that James is indeed playing in second gear, even after we account for his minutes, which have dipped this season to career-low levels.

Rebound rate? Dropped for the first time in five seasons. Assist rate? His lowest in eight seasons (32.4 percent of his teammates baskets while on the floor). Steal rate? Never been lower. Block rate? Career-low as well. Outside of shot-making, all the good things are down. Turnovers, on the other hand, are up to career-high levels.

So what's going on here?

Just before he left for Washington, D.C. to meet the President, I asked James that very question.

**The shooting department**

Here's something to chew on: The reigning MVP ranks tied for 18th in the NBA in field goal attempts per game (16.1).

James, the guy who seemingly can't miss, takes as many shots per game as Kemba Walker, and fewer shots than Al Jefferson. That doesn't consider the free throw line, but even when you add in foul shots, James ranks tied for 19th among qualified players (minimum 20 minutes per game).

For the coasting truthers, this is the hardest evidence that James is taking it easy. Shouldn't he be shooting more?

James said he often wonders that himself. Both he and Kevin Durant have played several games without their co-pilots this season, but James' shot attempts haven't sky-rocketed like Durant's have.

James sometimes wonders what would happen if he took as many shots as Durant does.
""I do get jealous, I'm not gonna lie,"" James said. ""I get jealous sometimes when I look over at KD and he's like 16-for-32 and then 14-for-34. ... Man.""

But that might require a different approach.

""First of all, you have to have an unbelievable mindset to get up 30 shots,"" James said. ""I always think about it, though. If I get up high-20s, 30 shots a game, what could I do today, with the way I'm playing?""

It's a question many basketball observers have asked, too. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra has said that if James was focused on scoring, he could ""realistically"" average 37 points per game.

But it's not as simple as ""shoot more, win more."" The Heat are 8-2 in James' 10 highest-usage games this season and 9-1 in his 10 lowest-usage games.

""I'm not much of a forced-shot guy,"" James said. ""But there are games where I have it going, and then at the end of the game, I'm like, damn, I shot just 12-for-16? Why don't I get up at least six or seven more? I definitely notice it.""

But the Heat's pace-and-space offense thrives on James' rare ability to create for himself and for others. The thinking is that Miami, which owns the second-most efficient offense in the land, has found a healthy equilibrium in which teams can't load up on James for fear that he'll hit the open teammate. As soon as he starts putting on the blinders, it might force an identity crisis for himself and his team.

""I think part of it is our offense,"" James said of his low shot total. ""It puts us all in an equal-opportunity situation.""

This is true, but the offense is also largely the same one that saw him shoot far more (18.1 field goal attempts) just two seasons ago.

Ultimately, though, James might not be that type of player anymore.

""I don't think it's part of my DNA,"" James says before cracking a smile. ""But I think if my teammates came to me and said, 'Listen. Tonight, go off, let's see what you can do.' I think I could do it then.""

**The defense**

Now consider this: The Heat have been 7.6 points per 100 possessions worse defensively with James on the floor, according to NBA.com. With him on the floor, the Heat have allowed 103.9 points per 100 possessions, which would rank 19th in the NBA. With him off the floor, the Heat have improved to 96.3 points allowed per 100 possessions, which would rank just behind the Indiana Pacers for second-best in the league.

James' defensive numbers have sagged considerably this season.
It might be hard to believe that this is the same guy who drew Defensive Player of the Year buzz last season, but James' work on the defensive end has fallen off dramatically.

And it's not just the on-court/off-court numbers, either. James is currently blocking 0.3 shots per 36 minutes. That's less than half his career rate. Same as Kyle Korver, Stephen Curry and Matt Bonner. Fewer per minute than Kyrie Irving, Mo Williams and John Wall.

""I haven't gotten many chase-down blocks this year,"" James says. ""Guys aren't challenging me as much. I mean, I've had a couple guys turnaround and actually dribble the ball out.""

That's true to some extent. James points to specific examples involving Landry Fields a few games ago and J.J. Redick, who pulled up for an awkward midrange jumper on a fast break and clanked it back in November. But those are the exception rather than the rule. It's almost unbelievable that a player of James' off-the-charts athleticism and instincts has yet to tally two blocks in the same game this season.

James' steal rate has also tumbled, dropping to a career-low 1.3 swipes per 36 minutes.

""I don't know why my blocks and steals are down, not quite sure,"" James says before joking, ""'Rio' [Mario Chalmers] and D-Wade are always stealing everything. That's where my steals have gone.""

**Is James coasting?**

By all accounts, James is a basketball genius. But there's a difference between what he can do and what he has done this season. 

James can consistently guard positions 1-through-5, but that doesn't mean he has consistently guarded 1-through-5 this season. James can take over a game at will, but that doesn't mean he has taken over games at his will.

The impetus to do so, though, may not be there yet. The Heat are sitting comfortably as the No. 2 seed in a dreadful Eastern Conference, with a 7.5 game buffer in the standings and still within reach of the Pacers. 

And consider the mileage. Counting preseason, regular-season and postseason, James has played more games than any NBA player since joining the Heat back in 2010 -- 340 games and nearly 13,000 minutes in all.

But for James, this isn't coasting. It's more like energy management.

""I cannot coast,"" James said, ""because I don't know if the next game will be the last game I've ever played. It's my mindset, when I get out on the floor, I gotta go hard. I don't know where it came from, the way I was brought up, the way I played when I was a kid.""

To be clear, James even in second gear is better than just about every player in the game. His 29.3 player efficiency rating is still second in the league behind Durant, even if it's down from last season's league-leading 31.7 rate. By every measure, James remains a dominant force overall -- even if this Heat season feels like an 82-game preseason.

But James' numbers do speak volumes.

""I'm listening to the numbers. Even though I'm not a big numbers guy, I do my part,"" James said. ""Maybe I do have to start ramping it up a little but more.""

With two days off this weekend and a refreshing visit to the White House on Tuesday, James promises we'll see a different James against the 17-19 Washington Wizards.

That's got to be the sickest subtle burn I've seen from LeBron ever. Is this an onion article? He basically just called out KD for being a chucker.

475,"Lebron has reached a very strange level that I don't think I've ever seen in an NBA player. It's like he plays the game on an entirely different plane and makes sure to give JUST enough to accomplish his goals without expending any ounce more of energy. He only takes the shots he needs to take, defers the ball the right amount to keep his teammates happy (and competent), gives just enough energy on defense to keep his team going. He could probably be going out and destroying things right now, but that's just not his goal. He just needs to gives the right amount of energy and take the right kind of shots to keep his team in every game. But not so much that he would be expending excessive energy.

Not saying that this is good or bad... in fact, it's good AND bad in a few different ways. Calling it ""coasting"" ordinarily implies being lazy, indifferent, or a little self-satisfied... when in reality, it's more like ""extremely calculated energy conservation"" (maybe just a fancy way of saying the same thing, but his plays seems far more deliberate and precise than just ""coasting""). I am definitely familiar with teams taking it easy (e.g. Shaq/Kobe Lakers, Spurs' famous minutes conservation, etc.), but it just feels like he's just meta-gaming more than I've ever seen anyone play.",27,theblackhole25,/r/nba/comments/1v759a/insider_request_is_lebron_james_coasting/cepislg/,cepislg,1389759208.0,1389730408.0,INSIDER REQUEST: Is LeBron James coasting?,46,1v759a

First off, Kobe doesn't belong here. He's the #2 SG, no doubt, but by an absurd amount. 

I love LBJ, he is a marvel to behold and since I've lived long enough to see stars shine and fade away, I try and soak in his career as much as possible. 

That being said, I have to remark upon subjects that continually get brought up:

LeBron playing D on all 5 positions is ridiculous since the quality of 5's in the league today is so low that Center has been left off the [All-Star](http://www.nba.com/2012/news/10/23/all-star-centers-ballot/) ballot. He is absolutely versatile, and *that* is what he should be known for. There's no way he's handling Shaq, Hakeem, or Kareem. This is obvious. 

I constantly hear about hand checking and zone defensive rule changes and people assume that Jordan wouldn't be able to adjust or expose weaknesses like players do today. The 3 point game and spacing philosophy weren't what they've become today. By saying Jordan wouldn't have worked on his 3pt shooting and spacing more is to not know the type of person MJ was. Although, it is foreshadowing that Steve Kerr has the highest 3pt % in a season of all time.

Passing and court vision is a great quality that both players have. And I know for a fact that the time MJ was asked to play [PG](http://ballislife.com/michael-jordan-could-of-been-the-best-point-guard-ever-want-proof/), he nearly averaged a triple double has been covered here before. 

Look, I understand what watching sports does for people as they watch them. They believe that the best player of *their* generation is the best of all time. It makes sense, it really does. I also understand that most redditors in this sub reddit are in their early 20's. There's so much more than stats or age or number of seasons played. 

The load MJ carried, in the era he played in, coupled with his psychotic drive to win at all costs (including playing 304 of [304](http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jordami01.html) games consecutively) has to be a beacon of what made him the greatest competitor in the NBA, and perhaps, any team sport we have. 

Can't we just wait until LBJ is reTIRED?

678,"Well, the Pistons and their fans hated Jordan.  Before Jordan won a championship, there were also older sportswriters who considered Jordan a ball hog.  

In general, though, Jordan was very careful about his reputation.  He never publicly feuded with management, even when he was grossly underpaid.  He cultivated writers who wrote glowing articles about his achievements on the court and his charity off the court.  He would refuse to open the locker room for interviews until he had showered and put on a suit for interviews.  He was much more careful about his extramarital activities than Tiger Woods -- not that there weren't any, but girls were carefully screened.  

In fact, it got to the point where he rarely left his hotel during road trips, something that Charles Barkley, who didn't worry about his reputation at all, found incredible.  One reason Jordan loved golf is that at most private clubs he could play without fear of being disturbed or creating news.  He was a prisoner of his own image.

Not until Sam Smith published The Jordan Rules did some of the unfavorable stories come to light, and not until he played baseball did Sports Illustrated dare to ridicule him -- and, as a result, Jordan refused to cooperate with SI throughout his second threepeat.  It was easier for him to control his public image in those days, and he was the first player whose image was also shaped by a Nike advertising campaign.

In recent years, it seems to me that he has deliberately undermined his own image, wearing odd clothing, saying whatever he wants, even growing a Hitler mustache.

679,"Jordan benefited from the fact that when he played, there were serious VILLAINS for you to hate. From the late eighties until around 1992, everyone hated the ""Bad Boy"" Pistons so much that you had no hate left over for anyone else. Even in Portland, who you would think would naturally hate Jordan for some of his comments about our city, we sympathized with what Jordan went through dealing with the Pistons. We hated the players on the Pistons to such an incredible level that we were happy when Jordan finally got over the hump against them. 

Even if the Jordan Rules had come out in '89 or if there would have been an increased media scrutiny about him back then... Jordan still would not have been very hated. We had Barkley spitting on a kid, we had Laimbeer thugging all over the place, guys like Xavier McDaniel roamed the courts, you had players who you seriously hated. With a passion. I remember when Malone blew up Isiah Thomas's face with his elbow, everyone I knew loved that Isiah finally ""got what was coming to him."" If I ran into Bill Laimbeer on the street, I'd be seriously tempted to kick him right in the knee today, decades later. Fuck him. 

Lebron doesn't have that kind of ""protection"" in terms of other players in the league being notorious assholes that you want to throw over the side of a bridge. The closest thing he had was Garnett on the Celtics, but nothing KG did could even compare to the thuggery and assness of the players back in Jordan's era.

I can't find any source other than the tweet you posted.",38,JimboBojangles,/r/nba/comments/1slour/charles_barkley_on_analytics_im_not_even_sure/cdyw05n/,cdyw05n,1386765426.0,1386736626.0,"Charles Barkley on analytics: ""I'm not even sure what that means.

920,"Barkley actually touches on a good point. What is analytics? Is analytics exclusively just ""number crunching""? 

Here is R.C. Buford's take on analytics the 2013 MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference 

>""I think the decisions that happen throughout the course of the season can't be done without an approach of heavy analysis, but I don't think it's necessarily limited to number crunching. So for that reason, if somebody just says “I'm going to do this- the way I do it- just because,” and it's not interdependent on who we're playing and who plays for us and the circumstances. Then I think you'd have to step back and say “is that person I'd want leading my team.""

Charles Barkley is right in that it's hard to define what analytics is, but it's there and it's making a difference for better or worse. Everyone that's downplaying the role of advanced analytics needs to re-assess how ubiquitous it is among all major sports leagues. Just look at all of the big analytics users that are currently in high front office positions or have made significant contributions in previous seasons: assistant GM Mike Zarren and head coach Brad Stevens in Boston, GM Daryl Morey in Houston, GM Sam Hinkie in Philadelphia, Basketball Analytics manager Ben ""Wiz"" Falk in Portland (who Kevin Pritchard hired), GM Rich Cho in Charlotte, owner Vivek Ranadive and GM Pete D'alessandro in Sacramento, owner Joe Lacob and GM Bob Myers in Golden State, GM Ryan McDonough in Phoenix, Dean Oliver in Denver, VPO John Hollinger in Memphis, GM Sam Presti in Oklahoma, owner Mark Cuban in Dallas, and a lot more.

Plus, there are major decisions that are (at least partly) influenced by advanced analytics: IU Professor Wayne Winston assisted Dallas's selection of Rick Carlisle, Dean Oliver assisted Denver's draft of Ty Lawson, Mike Zarren has made *major contributions* to Boston's offensive and defensive systems since 2007, San Antonio's analytics team helped the Spurs reformulate their defensive strategy after their defensive slump around '08, Sam Presti is credited with finding Tony Parker and he is the designer of the scouting database system in San Antonio, the two for one strategy, the decline in the mid-range jumper, the growing popularity in contract season players, and so on.

The use and application of advanced analytics is a lot more substantial than most would believe.

So, yeah. The stats pretty clearly say it's MJ.

LeBron dominates in terms of raw stats because he's played 138 playoffs games through age 28 to MJ's 92. The fact that they are still close in certain raw statistical categories is a point for MJ, not LeBron.",21,,/r/nba/comments/1seas4/thought_this_was_interesting_wanted_to_share/cdwwpba/,cdwwpba,1386570875.0,1386542075.0,"Thought this was interesting, wanted to share.

948,"Here are some basic stats I put together. I took LeBron's last 6 seasons and compared them to what I thought were roughly Kobe's best 6 seasons. The seasons I used for Kobe were 02-03, 05-06, 06-07, 07-08, 08-09, 12-13.

* TS%: **LeBron .600** Kobe .566

* RPG: **LeBron 7.7** Kobe 5.83

* APG: **LeBron 7.25** Kobe 5.35

* SPG: **LeBron 1.72** Kobe 1.68

* BPG: **LeBron 0.92** Kobe 0.5

* TOV: LeBron 3.3 **Kobe 3.22**

* PPG: LeBron 28.12 **Kobe 29.9**

So LeBron has him beat in nearly every category and even scoring wise most people would prefer 28 PPG at 60% TS over 30 PPG at 56%. The biggest take away from this is how differently they play the game but how overall they seem to achieve the same results. What in my opinion gives LeBron the advantage is 2 things:

* His ability to pass coupled with his willingness to pass
* How much of a freak athlete he is

These 2 points I believe really explain the difference between him and Kobe. Kobe can pass, hell he can pass very well, it's just that he can't pass as well as LeBron nor is he as willing to part with the ball as LeBron is. I think that's the best explanation for why LeBron gets about 2 more assists than Kobe every game they play.

The second part is even simpler, LeBron weighs about 50 more pounds than Kobe, is more athletic (jumps higher, stronger, probably faster) and is a bit taller. That's just a genetic advantage which he has over everyone who's ever played the game not named Wilt and Shaq.

Now I don't like any of the defensive metrics they have out there because any ones I've seen all seem a bit wonky and haven't found a way to somehow factor out teammates as of yet. From watching the two, I would take Kobe before I take LeBron to shut down a player from a PG to a SF. I would be more comfortable with Kobe guarding LeBron than LeBron having to guard Kobe in their primes. Kobe was very quick and very coordinated and even last year when you saw him focused in on his matchup (rarely happened as he was free roaming too much), he was a tough guy to drive around off the dribble. Where LeBron shines is his versatility on that end. He can guard every position for a certain time before getting back to his. I don't think he has the lateral quickness to accelerate side to side to guard a PG or elite 2 guard for an entire game but we've seen him take a Tony Parker or Derrick Rose out of a 4th quarter or him fronting the post on Pau and not allowing him to gain position.

I love Kobe, I'm a homer and hell I'll argue prime Kobe doesn't get some of the credit he deserves on this subreddit due to him being a Laker and our fan base overrating him to a point where others feel they have to downgrade him to even it out **BUT** ^LeBron ^is ^better. Now don't rub it in my face and say ""OH IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE"" because it is close and Kobe isn't a scrub and he's made his style of play nearly as effective as LeBrons but LeBron can just do it more efficiently. There's so much more I could say about their styles of play and the systems they've played in and how defenses react to each player but I think this is enough for now.",230,Terry_Pandee,/r/nba/comments/1sdn4f/dominique_wilkins_kobe_bryant_in_his_prime_was/cdwk52s/,cdwk52s,1386537253.0,1386508453.0,Dominique Wilkins: Kobe Bryant in his prime was probably a better all around player than Lebron James,153,1sdn4f

951,"This is just an example of a life lesson of sorts. While we all respect former/current NBA player's and stars, we have to take their opinions with a grain of salt. First off, unless they're hooked up to a lie detector, we don't even know if they're telling us their true opinion. Second, to say Kobe in his prime was a better overall player than Lebron is ridiculous. While it depends on the opinion of what ""overall player"" means to that individual, statistics are the only objective means to truly measure player performance. In terms of statistics, Kobe has never matched the ""overall"" performance of Lebron's 2nd season in which Lebron averaged 27 ppg on 47.2% (yes at age 20 Lebron shot a higher % than Kobe has in his 17 seasons, a % Lebron today has ecliped by over 10%), 7.4 rpg and 7.2apg, both higher than Kobe has ever posted over the course of an entire NBA season.

My personal definition of overall means they contribute to BASKETBALL in many different ways. Lebron, over his career, has proved to be a more efficient scoring threat, better facilitator, rebounder, and at least a more versatile defender than Kobe. While I will gladly admit Kobe is a bigger scoring threat on more areas of the court, really just mid range shooting, and he has better ""footwork"" as well as using post ups more, that all goes into the category of scoring which while it is a large portion of basketball, is just 1 of many and doesn't necessarily usurp the other parts of what makes a complete (aka overall) basketball player.
