3,"really wish NBA did something about baselines and sidelines... 

there's so little room. the players are bigger, stronger and faster now. I want players to have more room to go wild, fly and jump around the court and not be  restrained by 1 goddamn foot of space around the court. 

what will it take for NBA to have like 3 ft of free space around the court like Europe? why do we even need people to be 1 ft away from players?? a fan with a concussion or death? season/career ending injury?

oh yeah... it's all for ticket sales and MONEY. with the freaking TV deals and whatever, NBA is still so greedy. don't overpay players like Kanter, use the money to make fans happier and improve fans/players' safety. nba can do more with all the money they are and will be making... come on...

If anything, it just makes more sense that Lebron is Superman and Curry is Batman. First, there's the difference in size and scoring approach to the game. 

Lebron: unworldly athleticism and speed and capitalizes on those strengths to get buckets. 

Steph: agile, cunning, and uses an array of tactics (from his utility belt) to score.

And you have the narrative of Lebron, who has long been the best player in basketball, the ""King,"" who is now facing doubts of his stature. In fact he's also been questioned whether he has too much power (control w/in organization, from Tristan Thompson's contract to dressing more professionally for game days). 

Steph is that challenger to the best in basketball. He's risen from obscurity to potential equal. 

Then there's the fan perspective. Steph is seen as human, and though he can perform inhuman feats, he'll always be limited by his size. Lebron is superhuman, and there's a notion that Lebron is holding back. He has this limitless ceiling, where we believe that if he was willing to devote his efforts, he could do whatever he wanted.

I'm a biased LeBron fan but you'd be hard-pressed to find a player who:

a.) Has stayed clear of off-court controversies. When your biggest blemish over a 13-year career is announcing where you are going for free agency (while still raising a million dollars for charity), then you are probably doing a pretty good job of being a consummate professional athlete.

b.) By all accounts he seems to be an incredible team player. I haven't read of any ex-teammates who have had problems with LeBron as a teammate.

c.) Lived up to the hype.

13195/27.3ppg= 483.33 games needed if his production stays consistent.  Assuming it doesnt, I'll round up modestly to 500.  Before the 15-16 season, LBJ played 911 career regular season games over his 12 year career. Assuming that he plays in the league another 8:

500/8= an average of 62.5 games played each seson over the next 8 years averaging 27.3 points will put him on pace to break the record set by Kareem Abdul-Jabar.  Even if he plays only 7 more years he only needs about 72 games per year to break it which again assumes a 27.3ppg average with extra games included in the calculations to offset a possible lower career ppg average.

Basically it seems that there are two effects: a ""
hot hand"" effect where players shoot better, but also a ""heat check"" effect where players take more difficult shots.  Defenders guarding a hot player more closely would also manifest itself in the ""heat check"" effect.  

When it comes to overall shooting percentage, these effects cancel each other out.  But the hot hand is still very real.

Just because a player gets hot, doesn't mean they shoot perfectly from the field. Harden and Curry in particular love ""heat check"" type shots which they may miss, but then will come back the next possession and drain a 30ft three. 

To me, getting ""hot"" is just as much getting in the zone where you are making a ridiculous amount of shots, but also just getting that confidence that anything you put up is going down. This allows the truly greats to just take over games it seems.

The Cavs are too good, if LBJ and Kyrie are healthy and play up to their potential and Love plays at half the level he is capable of they can win the title easily for 2-3 more years.

>John Andrew Davis (born July 20, 1954) is an American film producer and founder of Davis Entertainment.  ...

>Davis is also engaged in non-entertainment business ventures, including owning, operating, and starting various television stations since the 1980s, one of which still runs in Wisconsin, and Blaze Pizza, a Fast casual restaurant franchise. His partners for Blaze Pizza include Elise and Rick Wetzel (founder of Wetzel's Pretzels), Maria Shriver, professional basketball player LeBron James, and Boston Red Sox co-owner Tom Werner. In 2007, Davis and a group of investors sold their ownership stakes in Wetzel's Pretzels, which Davis helped grow.
