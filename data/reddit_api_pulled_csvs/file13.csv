8,"If I were a manager/agent for an NBA player, for branding purposes, I'd suggest they'd wake up on Saturday morning and post something like this at 5:30am (but also get the real work done).

>""This was when I first got to New England, we had become friends and we were in the weight room. I show up around 6:30 in the morning and he says to me, 'Good afternoon!' So the next day, I get the hint, and come in 15 minutes earlier. Same thing: He says, 'Good afternoon!' Then the next day it's 5:45 in the morning, and he makes sure to say it twice: 'Good afternoon! Good afternoon!' So I make it at 5:30 the next day and before he could say anything to me, I looked at him and said, 'Man, I don't give a damn what you say, Tom, I'm not coming in earlier than 5:30!'

* All data from [NBA.com](http://stats.nba.com/).
* Data is from the 2016-17 regular season.
* I included all play types except P&R Roll Man because none of them have many possessions of that type.
* Each of the light dots is another player that met the minimum number of possessions for that play type.

#### Observations

* Even though all three of these guys are above-average iso and post up players, those plays are still relatively inefficient for them.
* Overall, it looks like the order in terms of versatility is KD > Kawhi > LeBron. Admittedly teammates have an effect on this (i.e. KD is surrounded by the best offensive teammates).
* The graph doesn't count plays where someone passes it out. For example, if LeBron is posting up then passes it out to a teammate who shoots a 3, the possession counts as a spot up 3 for the teammate, not a post up for LeBron. As a result, good playmakers (like LeBron) are underrated.

215,LeBron's defense in game 1 was legitimately bad all across the board and you saw that in these highilghts. His defense in the 4th quarter on Durant in game 2 also wasn't good. Alot of the other makes you can live with; just good shots on solid contests or Durant being Durant. But that game 1 in particular was a mess and really the first two games of the series were what cost Cleveland; once you are down 2-0 you arent winning 4 out of 5 vs that GSW team again for the 2nd straight time ,329,dropdatdurkadurk,/r/nba/comments/6tistn/kd_shot_1825_72_when_guarded_by_lebron_james_in/dll0dpa/,dll0dpa,1502699887.0,1502671087.0,KD shot 18-25 (72%) when guarded by LeBron James in the NBA Finals,1983,6tistn

218,"There was once a guy in the Bulls sub who argued with me for like 50 comments that the Cavs were fine on D without Bron and LeBron doesn't define who they were on the defensive side, especially in the Finals last year (2016). He had some youtube video showing LeBron missing switches and assignments from the 2016 NBA finals first two games. Really dumb shit. Ignoring that the Cavs won 4 of the next 5 games

Well this proves it. If LeBron isn't playing great defense, the Cavs have 0 shot to stop the Warriors buzzsaw. Barnes being LeBron's natural matchup made it so that he could sag off and go chase around Draymond and throw a wrench in the small ball ""death"" lineup and could switch to the frontcourt to guard Curry whenever he wanted to. This is why RJeff was so instrumental, he held it down while LeBron was in the front court and off ball. 

To counter LeBron, the Warriors not only got someone at the 3 who LeBron couldn't sag off, but one of the *top 5 small forwards of all time* who can actually go shot for shot with him and win. It's incredible. And this is why the Cavs will have 0 shot of stopping the Warriors on defense from now until the end of the Superteam era. It honestly doesn't matter if LeBron pulls another 2016 defensive effort out of his ass or phones it in. Durant will *never* be bad enough to let LeBron look elsewhere for even a second. And he needs to be *everywhere* for them to even have a shot",204,Riderz_of_Brohan,/r/nba/comments/6tistn/kd_shot_1825_72_when_guarded_by_lebron_james_in/dll1sqk/,dll1sqk,1502701720.0,1502672920.0,KD shot 18-25 (72%) when guarded by LeBron James in the NBA Finals,1983,6tistn

340,"It's all that combined with the fact that basketball (and specifically NBA basketball) is the sport that is least conducive to upsets. This applies both within one game and in the context of a series. Look at sports like Soccer/Hockey. Their low scoring nature, along with its free-flowing nature (meaning there are sizeable amounts of time where one team does not have full control of possession), makes even the slightest mistake punishable. Football is the same but in a different way. Football has concrete possessions, but less of them, and much less actual scoring plays. Same way, one small defensive mishap could impact a game more than several basketball plays. Basketball, if you miss a defensive rotation on one possession, no big deal. Just score on your team's next possession and you'll get another opportunity to defend on the other team's next possession. If a soccer/hockey/football defensive player makes one mishap, it could cost his team everything. The fact that basketball has both more total and concrete possessions (i.e. possessions where you have complete control of the ball), any small discrepancies are more or less expected to even out over the course of one game. 

Any team could get hot one game and beat the Warriors once, but to get past them you have to beat them 4 times. The elite teams know how to adjust and can win even when the other team has one or two good games. That is why sans a few exceptions here and there, the best team always wins in the NBA.

They don't have $80M in cap space next year. No team has that much space. Cap holds, look them up. 

Currently they have $54M on the books just in guaranteed money for 2018-19... that *might* be $50M in cap space without making any moves if the cap gets up to $104M, which it probably won't. But that's before considering cap holds and options - you're closer to $29M in cap space next year - you would need to make some moves to even sign one max player.

So while an interesting comparison, the fundamental argument is wrong. Messi is considered a top 2 player of all time. But his lack of universal GOAT status is because his competition is still playing, and in some respects playing at a higher level than him, at an older age.

I'm not going to debate the superiority of any particular offense over another. I'm not even going to debate whether or not Mike or Tyronn even ran/run something that could be considered an offense.

All I know is that I saw them both and I remember the loud whispers that Chicago should consider trading Michael and that he would never win and I sat through the many losses.

I also sat through years where I all could do is shake my head that LeBron was still able to get as far as he did year after year, even without a championship. He has an absolutely brilliant basketball mind now, but he was borderline genius coming into the game, too.

433,"On one hand, you cannot blame LeBron for losing this series like you clearly could in 2011. OTOH, I don't think he can get a pass the way most people rightfully give him in 2007 and 2015.

I can already hear the fanboys angrily typing away...""28 POINTS ON 57% SHOOTING, YOU FUCKING HATER! REST OF HIS TEAM WAS TRASH!"" etc. 

Look, I realize the Spurs were the better team and were favored to win. But I also do not think, just like this past Finals, the difference between the two teams was as the scores and brevity of the series made it seem. Both 2014 and 2017, LeBron's teams had enough talent to at least make it a competitive series (with almost everyone having both series going to 6-7). However, I think the way LeBron's teams were dominated in both series were examples of teams exposing the flaws in LeBron's game and the construction of his roster.

People  wonder how LeBron can put up such great numbers at times while still being on the receiving ends of historic beatdowns. Truth is, it all plays into the opposing defenses strategies and reveals what defenses prioritize when playing LeBron's teams. We all know LeBron is an all-time great scorer, but what really propels him into that GOAT conversation is his ability to facilitate. His teams are at their best when LeBron drives to the lane at will and is able to force the defense to collapse, getting his shooters wide open 3's. What teams with the right combination of coaching and personnel have shown time and time again that the best way to defend him is to stay home on those shooters and force him to beat you through iso scoring. Like I said, you need the right personnel to do this (not all teams have a Kawhi/Iggy/Dray/Klay to make LeBron work for his points), but if you do, there is plenty of evidence to show it working. 

Both series showed how smart and disciplined defensive teams can really expose the one-dimensional, iso-based drive-n-kick offenses that LEBrons teams have been based off of. Had LeBron's game been more suited to establishing an actual offensive system around him, his teams wouldn't look so bad without him/he wouldn't be putting up seemingly good numbers to little or no avail",53,KashMoney941,/r/nba/comments/6rpwpy/in_the_14_finals_lebron_had_141_pts_on_91_fga/dl73d98/,dl73d98,1501956621.0,1501927821.0,In the '14 Finals LeBron had 141 PTS on 91 FGA.

So I feel like a large part of this is just the Lakers trying to create buzz for themselves and ensure they are on people's lips and minds.
