49,"My best analysis is that LeBron looked at this season and said that his health is most important thing.  To avoid injury but keep his career goals on track he would play offense but not risk his body on defense until the forth quarter if it looks like it will put them over the top that game.  He expected to minimize the damage on his body and health and minimize games lost by doing this but it hasn't worked out like he hoped it would, team is weaker and his decision to not play defense caused unexpected consequences over time as he continued to deploy this strategy.  Ie., his strategy is fine for one game but the effect on the team over the season is larger than he figured in his original decision.  His teammates know he won't help and put less effort themselves, lack of consistent help causes them to get demoralized and stop helping each other in general.  If you don't get help half the time you quickly decide not to bother putting max effort yourself.  Opponents recognized his decision quickly in the season and know they can get easy buckets earlier in the game and if they get ahead LeBron won't put effort into a come back so they come out gang busters knowing they can get a win by going hard the first half.  Opponents also know the three point line will be wide open because it requires the most effort to cover and without help and hustle you'll get wide open shots, so they come prepared to be shooting.",25,D_Orb,/r/nba/comments/7ucof0/the_cleveland_cavaliers_defensive_rating_ranks/dtjcjwe/,dtjcjwe,1517460217.0,1517431417.0,"The Cleveland Cavaliers' defensive rating ranks dead last in the NBA (111.7) when Lebron James is on the court.

115,"> LeBron James was asked about his thoughts on the huge trade that went down on Monday involving Blake Griffin going to the Detroit Pistons. As you may have heard, the Clippers told Griffin they wanted him to be a “Clipper for life” this past summer before eventually trading him.

> By now you’ve probably heard the saying “Sports Are A Business” so much that it shouldn’t be news to anyone. Team courts player, player buys in knowing full well the possibilities of said buying in, team flips player for the future. And unless you’re a child, you know the score by now.

> But James, being the most well-known player in the league and a pioneer in flexing his autonomy discussed the perception that teams do “the right thing for the franchise” when they trade someone like Griffin but when a player decides to move on, the narrative isn’t so forgiving.

> “When a player gets traded, they were doing what’s best for the franchise,” James told reporters at shootaround. “Then when a player decides to leave he’s not loyal, he’s a snake, he’s not committed. That’s the narrative of how it goes. I know that first hand.”

> The dysfunction around the Cavaliers is at new levels. Dan Gilbert is reportedly calling the shots in the basketball ops department and it appears that general manager Koby Altman is nothing more than a figurehead.

> James brings his own drama with him but the current Cavs dysfunction goes way beyond the way James’ presence magnifies every little thing that goes on in the Cavs locker room.

> Could be he setting the stage for another July exit from Northeast Ohio? With a non-basketball mind in Gilbert taking control of things, players being uninformed of the absence of an All-Star and communication lacking all over the place, it would be hard to blame him if that’s the conclusion he reaches.

119,"Reposting here: I think the reason why most fans are less inclined to call a GM ""disloyal"" for trading a player, as opposed to calling a player disloyal when he leaves a team, is that basketball is a **team** game -- so the team is expected to come first. If a GM caters too much to a player, to the point that it hurts the team, then most fans would agree that he's not doing his job (i.e. to look out for the team's interests first and foremost). Whereas if a player sacrifices himself for the team, well that's what he's supposed to be doing, so he's a hero to the fans as long as he keeps doing that -- but he's a traitor if he ever stops.

It's sort of an ""ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country"" kind of thing. If a country is at war and one of the soldiers defects to the other side, his countrymen call him a traitor. But if a commander makes a difficult decision to sacrifice some of his troops and thereby wins the war, he's a patriot. You won't hear many people accuse him of ""disloyalty,"" because his allegiance to his country is supposed to supersede even his allegiance to his own troops.

It's not a perfect analogy, obviously, but you get the idea -- the country is supposed to come first in that arrangement. An NBA player who leaves for another team and a GM who trades a player to another team are both being ""disloyal"" to each other, but the difference is that one is being disloyal in service of his team and one is being disloyal at the expense of that team.

Personally, I don't blame the GMs for trying to help their teams, **or** the players for trying to find the best situations for themselves. Players sacrificing for their team is awesome, of course, but it's hard to demand that a player sacrifice for a team if that team is mistreating him or whatever. And in the same vein, it's hard to blame a GM for doing what's best for his team, since that's his job. To take my Hawks as an example, getting rid of Korver, Teague, Millsap, and Howard was painful. It felt like we were betraying them. But if our GM hadn't been willing to make those moves to improve the team, then he would have -- and should have -- been replaced with someone who was. If you're a GM, the team comes first.",253,Buteo_jamaicensis,/r/nba/comments/7u423e/lebron_on_player_movement_when_a_player_gets/dthgjlc/,dthgjlc,1517375988.0,1517347188.0,"LeBron on player movement: ""When a player gets traded, they were doing what’s best for the franchise.

287,"So I actually don't think the draft order is too hard to suss out. Bron got first pick of the starters and Steph got first pick of reserves. I think that LeBron in particular drafted in a way that was very conscious of potential media narratives. 

**Starters**

LBJ: KD

SC: Giannis

LBJ: AD

SC: Harden

LBJ: Boogie

SC: Embiid

LBJ: Kyrie

SC: DD

*I think KD with the first pick is obvious, and then the only ones I'd be uncertain about here are Giannis and Harden, maybe Curry picked Harden first. Other than that I think LeBron picked KD/AD/Boogie trying to build a winning line up and then when the choice was left between Kyrie and DeRozan he went with Kyrie so that there wouldn't be a bunch of stories about how he snubbed Kyrie or that he's still bitter about that situation. I feel like there's also potential that he was fucking with Kyrie's head a little bit, just for fun.*

**Reserves**

SC: Klay 

LBJ: Love

SC: Draymond

LBJ: Russ

SC: Jimmy

LBJ: KP

SC: KAT

LBJ: Wall

SC: Dame

LBJ: Beal

SC: Lowry

LBJ: Oladipo

SC: Horford

LBJ: LMA

*I think both guys picked their teammates first from the reserves. Bron specifically picking Love early to squash another potential narrative about them not getting along. Then I think that Russ is the first ""real"" pick of the reserves, no doubt. I think Jimmy is probably viewed by Steph and Bron as being the best out of the guys remaining, so that's an easy pick for Steph. Bron goes big with KP, then Steph has to take KAT because he's getting totally roasted with Bron taking all the bigs. Then I think Bron goes for Wall because he needs more guards. Steph takes Dame as another kind of ""BPA"" situation. Bron takes Beal, and probably says something like ""taking Beal to go with Wall."" Then Steph comes back with ""Taking Lowry to be with DeRozan"". Bron takes Vic because he's still got more bigs than guards. Steph takes Horford, and Bron is left with the last pick - LMA.*",41,Brett420,/r/nba/comments/7t5c2y/shannon_sharpe_hype_about_team_lebron_oh_he_got/dta0vff/,dta0vff,1517013607.0,1516984807.0,"Shannon Sharpe hype about Team Lebron: ""Oh he got all them Ds.

>“I was feeling him, because he is,’’ Durant added. “He can score from anywhere. He can score on anybody. He can use both hands, but there’s something else that separates. You know what I’m saying? I think that’s just the difference, the mental part of it. And he’s got the foundation of his game set, it’s just time to build on top of it.”

468,"This logic only works for the Cavs when the East remains weak.  Old Cavs had 3 all star players playing against teams who usually had 2 at the most. Look at the damage Irving is able to do in a new uniform. Everyone knows what Love could do on his own too and LBJ is LBJ.

This logic is thrown out the window when either a) the Cavs really fall off or b) the East steps it up. As of right now, the Cavs better tighten it up because them ""turning it on"" also came with other teams shitting the bed. If they try to turn it on while another team in the East as never turned it off...then it's gonna be tough for the Cavs

All I know is this: If the Cavs are really good enough to just win playoff games whenever they feel like it and they're struggling right now in the regular season then why tf are they holding meetings and talking trades?

579,"**For LeBron:** Probably bounces, looking to make fresh splash somewhere else, unless he just wants to take big paycheck (if, for example, he feels the icy creep of Father Time and knows ahead of everyone else he has a very limited window left) or we can finagle a big move early in the off season.

**For the Cavs:** If LeBron's LeGone, we probably revert to Cleveland Basketball as it was known for so long - rebuilding with mid-range lottery picks and getting back to chasing that 8th seed. If LeBron stays, we'll try and make drastic lineup changes (somehow). If we can't make said changes, then He Gone by the following season (if things don't significantly improve in the meantime).

**For the League:** If LeBron leaves, balance of power in the East shifts clearly to teams like Boston, Toronto and Washington, with Milwaukee up and coming, plus a boost to wherever LeBron lands (if he stays in the East). Also, if he leaves or we just don't want to try and drive the Old Folk's Home bus back to the playoffs again, we'll probably try re-distributing a lot of our players around the league, either by not re-signing them or through trades.

Personally, I think the more interesting narrative would be us having the off-season fire sale (with or without LeBron leaving) just to see all the moves that could get made and who lands where, but I'm hoping that we don't have to worry about any of this this year and we get to have another Finals run.

830,"Reminder as well:

Curry is doing that on 49/41/92 shooting. That's maybe the most impressive part.

If you're curious (as I was), LeBron is shooting 56/37/77 which is actually great for him too, he shoots a career 50/34/74 so he's up on all fronts. They're in 2nd (Curry) and 7th (LeBron) in WS/48 and 1st (LeBron) and 8th (Curry) in VORP, as well as both being top 5 in PER.

Just a great time to be watching basketball right now, I know we can complain about reffing and not liking certain things about today's game but I look forward to telling my kids about watching Kevin Love's double double streak and Russ' triple-double season and Curry/Bron/KD's primes and the AD/Boogie big men combo and Dray's 5x5 and Thompson's 37 and the rise of Giannis and the insane rookie class (as of right now, Tatum, Simmons, Collins, Kuzma, Adebayo, Bell, Markkanen, Mitchell, Theis, and Allen are all beating Brogdon's ROTY PER last year, and that doesn't even include guys like Lonzo or Anunoby or Bogdanovic or Kennard or Fox who will probably have long NBA careers ahead of them), the presumably insane draft next year (Ayton, Young, Bagley, Porter, Doncic are a crazy enough top 5 to have, but remember that none of them are 20 yet AND that doesn't even look at guys like Bamba or Grayson Allen or others who could well be superstars), the fact that 12 of the best 20 3P seasons by an individual have happened since 2012, the revolution of big men that can take long shots, the insane rebounding of Jordan and Drummond, the fact that as of right now in the year, 12 different players are averaging a double double, the fact that right now, up to 6 guys have fairly realistic chances to shoot 50/40/90 this year alone.

Seeing how they both haven't missed any games, if they were to continue their season averages, Lebron would end at roughly 31023 and Dirk would be at 31269

Cavs have 39 games left, and Mavs 38. Difference between Dirk and LeBron is 843 points. Lebron is catching up by about 15 points a game (27.3 for lebron and 12.3 for dirk), so 15 x 38 is 570 plus an extra game for lebron is 597. Still will be 246 points away.

1. steph wasn't even in the play, there's no reason to screen him
2. steph wasn't moving, lebron knew exactly how much space he had to close
3. lebron has control of his body and is staring straight at curry before making a straight line into curry's body
4. lebron makes a jump stop into curry, which is a classic tactic to try and pop somebody as anyone who has played basketball has experienced. 
5. lebron never gets into an upright screening position, instead he is bent over the entire time which is what allows his knee to extend straight into curry's groin. 
6. lebron pulls the classic ""stare at a teammate and call out some nonsense to act like he wasn't paying attention when the reply showed he clearly knew what he was doing the entire time. 

there's tons of incidental contact that happens on every play.  this is not that type of contact. if you screen correctly you will never knew someone in the nuts. and furthermore lebron literally jumps into the path of curry. that's straight up intentional.

Fine. I will. I think Engelman has rigged RPM to give an answer that the fans want to see- ie, that the most popular players have similar ratings.

Curry- 1st by a long ways.

Harden- 53rd.
