51,"He makes fantastic points, and he's on point about one thing in particular: people who hate on LeBron are missing out on a generational talent. It's foolish to have such crazy standards for someone who is already doing what legends have done. He is already one of the greatest ever, turn on your TV and enjoy.

With that being said, he brushed off the East argument very quickly with poor comparisons, and I think he was too quick to equate Jordan and LeBron, not really argumentative but rather just accepting it as fact. He made some good point but also left a lot of holes here. Jordan's numbers are very real and do matter very much, they shouldn't be brushed off.

My biggest issue here was the East argument being countered with a Beyonce comparison instead of actual points. These things matter in the context of why people are going to dismiss final appearances. I'm not saying reaching the finals from the East isn't a feat, but if you're going to argue against people who don't appreciate LeBron and want to change their views, this is a critical point to address. I know people hate this circle jerk, but at the end of the day, the East's weakness is a serious talking point for things like this. It actually heavily factors into those things. Address it.

A comparison of their postseason careers inside.",1888,37gjcv
78,"For those interested in their playoff per game stats:

Jordan: 33.4 pts, 5.7 ast, 6.4 reb, 2.1 stl, 0.9 blk, 48.7 fg%, 33.2 3p%, 82.8 ft%, 28.6 PER

LeBron: 27.9 pts, 6.6 ast, 8.6 reb, 1.7 stl, 0.9 blk, 47.7 fg%, 31.9 3p%, 75.5 ft%, 27.5 PER

To sum up, LeBron gets an extra assist and 2 more rebounds per game than MJ, but MJ has 5.5 more points and .5 more steals per game while shooting a slightly better percentage from the field and the line. I've got to give the slight overall edge to Michael Jordan. It's close, but MJ is the greatest scorer in NBA history and he took it to another level in the playoffs. I don't think LeBron's more balanced overall game makes up for that point differential. But again, it is really close.

**Edit**: Because it was asked, Jordan made 3.1 turnovers per game while LeBron makes 3.5. Also interesting to note, despite LeBron being a better rebounder MJ averaged more offensive rebounds per game, 1.7 to 1.5. I think both of those tilt it even more clearly in MJ's favor.

**Edit 2**: Last bit I'm doing. Per 100 quick summary: LeBron 36.3 pt, 11.2 reb 8.6 ast, 2.2 stl. Jordan 43.3 pts (goddamn), 8.3 reb, 7.4 ast, 2.7 stl. 

True shooting percentage 56.8% for MJ and 57% for LeBron, but taking into account that TS% greatly favors 3-pointers and the game has greatly changed (MJ 9.9% of shots were 3's, LeBron 21.7%) I'm not sure how relevant that is.

For future questions, [Jordan's stats](http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jordami01.html) and [LeBron's stats](http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jamesle01.html). 


**Edit 3**: Fine. Since people apparently need to see this...

Kobe: 25.6 pts, 5.1 reb, 4.7 ast, 1.4 stl, 0.7 blk, 44.8 fg %, 33.1 3pt%, 81.6 ft%, 22.4 PER, 2.9 TOV.
Also has a 54.4 TS% and 34.7, 6.9, 6.4, 1.9 per 100 possessions.

There, are you happy? Kobe is really good, but really good means worse than MJ at everything except turnovers and everything except 3pt%, ft% and turnovers than LeBron. Sorry Kobe lovers, but he is not as good as MJ and will most probably end up behind LeBron as well.",479,TheDonbot,/r/nba/comments/37gjcv/if_the_finals_go_to_7_games_and_lebron_plays_in/crmkcue/,crmkcue,1432769591.0,1432740791.0,"If the Finals go to 7 games and LeBron plays in each, he'll tie Jordan with 179 career playoff games.

With a variation of +/- 5%, that's within the total **career** minute totals of Chris Paul, Amare Stoudemire, Larry Johnson, Elden Campbell, Rick Mahorn, Alonzo Mourning, Tyson Chandler, Avery Johnson, Peja Stojakovic, Antonion Davis, and George Gervin.

277,"Despite being the type to always root for the underdog, lately I find myself really cheering for LeBron. Growing older it seems like you appreciate greatness and hard work more and focus less on trivial things that once could make you hate things or even people. Also, being a life long VC fan I have a huge soft spot for players that get a lot of hate, and after that Decision debacle Lebron was definitely receiving a lot of hate. 

Getting to the finals with this beat down Cavs team is an incredible accomplishment, even in the weak East. And making 5 straight finals is unbelievable, even in the weak East. I'm just really, really hoping he wins it this year. Going 2 for 5 in that stretch would not be good for his legacy, but winning it this year would be HUGE. 

When you look back on history time kind of compresses and you just see the major highs and lows. With all-time great players its usually just highs and their shortcomings are quickly overshadowed. There are those of course who were all-time great but could never shake a certain label or narrative. Imagine if Lebron loses this year, and then loses a couple more. That's the type of narrative that would stick with him in a negative light despite his greatness.

James said a positive development in the sporting world for a community, such as a deep playoff run for the Cavs, can help heal a community.


""It doesn't matter what city it is, something that's going through a city that's very traumatic, traumatizing or anything of that case, I think sports is the biggest healers in helping the city out,"" he said.


""Sports just does something to people, either if you're a player, you're a fan, if you just have something that has anything to do with that city, you just feel a certain way about rooting for a team that you love, get your mind off some of the hardships that may be going on throughout your life or maybe that particular time or period.

518,"From the NBA rulebook, only rules regarding touching the rim for basket interference:

—A Player Shall Not:

h. Vibrate the rim, net or backboard so as to cause the ball to make an unnatural
bounce, or bend or move the rim to an off-center position **when the ball is touching the ring
or passing through**.

i. Touch the rim, net or ball **while the ball is in the net**, preventing it from clearing the
basket.

I think this should put to rest the question of basket interference on both Lebron's and Blake's block attempts.

Edit:  Oops, this was also in there:

b. A defensive player who deliberately gains or maintains height or hangs on his opponent’s
basket ring, net, backboard or support shall be assessed a non-unsportsmanlike technical
foul. If he touches the ball during a field goal attempt, points shall be awarded consistent
with the type of shot

But I dont think either LBJ or Blake did that.

535,"In arguing about the need for a shorter season, Simmons has been making the point about the defensive effort used by players in the whole game, opposed to the 80's. 

I think the quality of the average NBA player, as a whole (meaning taken as a replacement level) was likely higher in the 80's than in the 90's (expansion) and 2000's (high schoolers and unproven internationals), and probably is about equal today. 

By this I mean, if you took the 3rd best player on the 1985 Bullets and compared them, on average to the rest of the league... then did the same for the 2015 Wizards, you might have similar numbers. 

However, even while Magic and them were more fundamentally sound, by and large, the complexity of the scouting, emphasis on game long D, and improvements in speed makes the opposite true. 

I think if 26 year old Magic was transported from 1987 into today's NBA, it would be him making the adjustment to the league, not the other way around (as it might had done in the 90's or 00's). 87 Magic would almost certainly rise above the level of his peers after a half season, but it's not like he would be moving from the NBA to the NCAA, which is how he sees it. He'd be gasping for air in the 2nd period after trying to cover the 3 around the wildly more complex pick and roll game of today's era (god forbid he played the Spurs)

Conversely, if you put Steph, 07 Dirk, or 09 LeBron in the 80's, I think skills would still transcend, and given their knowledge of the game via enhanced analytics and game strategy, they would fundamentally shift the game. LeBron would dominate people like 87 MJ, but with more power. Dirk would not only feast on 80% of the centers, but could hit threes over anyone. And I can't even imagine what Steph would do... would his three rate change the whole way people looked at the arc and kickstart the 3 revolution by 20 years? 

I love Magic, but he's dreaming if he thinks the NBA today and 30 years ago are apples to apples.

I never doubted his basketball ability, I don't think anyone really did, but I thought he was going to be the leagues biggest diva. I thought I was going to hate him. I was partially correct, but things like ""the Decision"" makes a lot more sense when you put it in the context of the hype that he'd been getting since high school. He took his lumps the first year in Miami, for the first time in his life people hated him, and he was forced to look in the mirror a little bit. I think it made him a better person. I'm actually really impressed by the way he's handled himself. Again, not saying that Lebron is the highest character guy in the world, but considering the circumstances, I'm really impressed with who he is as a person.

IMO, I think he was surprising in that he actually met and even exceeded those expectations. When he first came in, the most surprising and amazing thing to me was his passing. He was just out of high school and making these amazing passes. Most high schoolers with the physical advantages of an NBA type player just wanna score and dunk. Lebron was playing a very advanced game from his first day in the NBA, fresh out of high school. That's what you younger people who think Anthony Davis or Curry are really great don't understand. In Lebrons first NBA game, with no college at all, he played like a veteran star NBA player. Not just doing one thing well, not needing a couple of years to develop skills like AD and Curry after some college. Just fresh out of HS, top 15 player in the league. Young people need to appreciate what they are watching with lebron, because you won't see it again in your lifetime.

You know what it does to an opponent mentally- to know that no matter what run you make, the counter punch is inevitably coming?  This is what guys like MJ, Kobe, and Wade were especially good at.

Keep in mind that Ainge has proven to be a savvy GM.

Also keep in mind that no matter how much we now see Yao as an amazing ex-player who's career was cut short by injuries exacerbated by his Chinese National Team use in addition to his unusually large frame, there was a **whole lot of uncertainty** about Yao's ability to be a capable NBA player. Every prior +7'5"" player had been a marginal talent with shot-blocking to be the one caveat allowing their entry into the league. Hell, even *The Chuckster* on TNT bet that Yao wouldn't score 20 points in a game during his rookie season.

977,"Sorry if this offends anyone, but I'm just going to write what I think, and I'll welcome anyone to explain their point of view to me. 

First, I'll get Harden out of the way. Harden is an excellent shooting guard, if not the best in the game right now. He's a scoring machine, and can draw fouls at a crazy rate. He's also extremely good at assisting the others on his team, because he can really suck in defenders with his dribble penetration. In late game situations and in late clock situations, he can bail his team out with his iso play, and even though the system he's been placed in emphasizes three's and inside scoring, his iso game from mid range is money, and he's hit some clutch stepback long twos as well. 

I think that it goes to say that LeBron can do all of this though. In fact, in terms of creativity, LeBron is probably a better facilitator than Harden is. I also think that LeBron plays better defense. Harden has made huge strides in his defense, as evidenced by his defensive stats, but no one considers him the defensive juggernaut that LeBron is (though LeBron's been playing a little less defense this year- maybe because he doesn't have to?). Needless to say, LeBron is also stronger than Harden, and that makes him a better finisher and a better rebounder, but that's expected since LeBron's a front court player, while Harden's in the backcourt. LeBron's is also MUCH more efficient than Harden is, and LeBron has recently added a lot of new offensive skills- he's more confident from three and he's shooting fairly well (35%) from there, he has a more respected jumper now, and he has a post game. He's always been excellent on drives, and can bully his way through the defense. I also think that it's crazy that LeBron is averaging more assists per game than Harden is, especially when LeBron isn't the only one that can create offense on his team (Kyrie), but Harden is largely considered to be the only one that can create offense. All in all, this puts LeBron James a couple of notches above James Harden. 

Now for Steph Curry. I think it's actually really hard to make the comparison between the two. We're comparing a decent shooter, with arguably the best shooter to ever play the game. We're also comparing arguably the best finisher in the league with an above average finisher. In terms of facilitating, both of them are maestros, and they orchestrate the offense when they're on the floor. Steph averages more assists, and he might even have had more (+2?) if he played during 4th. He's also rebounding fairly well. 

I think the difference is that if both of them play the game fully dialed in at 100%, LeBron still wins out. That might just be because of the fact that they're both equally good at scoring (Steph's shot is wet, and has become a really good finisher, but LeBron's offensive repertoire is definitely bigger in terms of how many different methods of scoring he has) and facilitating, but LeBron is a MUCH MUCH better defender (Steph is below average, average at best). Also, as a virtue of his size and position, he can affect the game in a few more ways (rebounding, playing outside-in as well as inside-out; not to say that Steph can't create opportunities with dribble penetration, but we have to remember that LeBron can do that as well as pass out of post-ups). I think that their ability to draw defenders is comparable, but in different ways. Steph should never be left open from three and teams will try to prevent that, but on the same token, Lebron will NEVER be given an open lane, and a LeBron drive is probably one of the most feared and effective plays in the NBA today. I still think that LeBron is a little bit above Steph. 

Overall, I think that Steph is closer to LeBron than Harden is, namely because of efficiency (I understand that FTs are incredibly effective, but when you're not getting calls, you need to post a high FG%; Harden isn't always able to do that- see Playoffs 2014). I think that Steph will win MVP, but given the circumstances surrounding their respective teams, I think Harden is MY MVP. 

I'm also of the opinion that (last season's) Kevin Durant is still better than both of those players, though we'll have to see what kind of player he is when he comes back. A decent defender, maybe average, and I think you can argue above average. OKC's defense has suffered without him and Ibaka, but it's not all just because Ibaka's out, because KD's length can bother his man a lot. Decent rebounder, and was becoming a better and better facilitator as OKC was forced to run the offense through him more than ever last season. His dribble penetration and shot draw defenders, and you have to defend him all the way out to the three point line. And of course, probably the more fearsome offensive repertoire game in the league (I'd say that Melo's is more robust though, since he has a post-game). Off the dribble, spot up, driving, mid range, iso, crossover-step-back, out of the double team- you name it and he's got it (except a strong post game), and he does it while posting shooting %ages around 50/40/90. With that usage rate? Good God. Probably the most offensively gifted player the NBA has seen. Closest thing to LeBron we've had so far, and even he was a bit far off, because his court vision isn't as refined as LeBron's is, which makes LeBron a better facilitator than KD.
