57,"This sub is so god damned misinformed about the pick. You have to match salaries people. Who is taking TT/Frye/Pick for their star? Pelicans aren't doing it, Clippers aren't doing it, Grizzlies aren't doing it. So who are you people even talking about? Dwight Howard? That seems like a great fit to me, but I don't think the Cavs want him. And then what, the Cavs are supposed to integrate *another* star into their team when they still need to reintegrate IT and Rose? That makes no sense. And the pick probably isn't going to gain value, if anything the Nets could end up passing the Hornets by the end of the season.

Cav's FO seems to be on the same page as Lebron. It's the other players on the team that don't seem to be on the same page. TT/JR/Shump are three rotation players that don't seem to care bout basketball anymore. Rose is always injured and can barely be considered a part of the team at this point. Love is balling out, but they are just horrible with him at center defensively. Jae Crowder could legit be out of the league in a year or two.

242,"LeBron James was eating at a taco spot here in Central Florida when he saw Grambling State's Shakyla Hill recorded a quadruple double in a women's college basketball game this week.

""Me and Swish (J.R. Smith) was like 'holy sh..., that's impressive,'"" James said Saturday. ""It doesn't matter what level you at, what type of league you in, male or female, you able to get a quadruple double in any facet, obviously not with turnovers. She did it with steals.

""Did you see her stat line at halftime? She had like four points, three rebounds, three steals, three assists. Like, and she went off in the second half, so big congratulations to her for sure.""

Hill put up 15 points, 10 rebounds, 10 steals, and 10 assists against Alabama State Wednesday night. She received congratulatory messages from Chris Paul and James Harden, but said on ESPN's SC6 that the player she really wanted to hear from was James.

Now, she has.

""[Lue] is coming up to me and saying, 'We've got to play faster,' and I probably wasn't willing to accept it at the time. So maybe I'd like a do-over on that.

>""But those conversations go on every day in the NBA. In this case, instead of those things being addressed so you can move forward, it gets held on to, and it becomes a big thing. I was trying to figure out where I fit in and at the same time asking myself, 'What's best for the team?' Sometimes, I didn't know the answer. I had to figure it out on my own. It wasn't like I was getting answers from everyone else.""

And perhaps the more important part of the piece:

I think my reading of it fits in with why Kyrie was frustrated playing in Cleveland. He's been up front that he has wanted the challenge of being the primary option/lead playmaker on a team.

It was fun, it was a fun procedure."" How did James become involved in the design process? ""Um, well I have a pretty good relationship with the makers of the uniforms and I have a pretty good relationship with the company that’s wearing the uniforms,"" he said, making not-so-subtle references to Nike and the Cavs. ""I was a part of pretty much the whole process. If we’re changing, we wanted to kind of change our logo and things of that nature. Any time I get a little input on something like that I think it’s pretty cool. I like to wear ‘em, I like to know what my teammates like and then I like to know what our fans would like to see when they’re wearing ‘em to our games and things of that nature, not only at home, but on the road. I’m looking forward to wearing The Land uniforms in The Land.""

746,"All of KD’s quotes from the interview. 


> Durant told GQ in November that he viewed that moment as James “passing the torch to me.” Durant clarified this week what that play meant.

> “I saw a lot of people took that out of context: What I’m saying is when somebody passes the torch, they’re letting you in the room,” Durant said. “You got LeBron. You got [Dwyane Wade]. You got [Carmelo Anthony]. You got Paul Pierce. You got Larry Bird. You got Dr. J all in a room. It’s my turn to be in there with them and enjoy being one of the best players in the world. It wasn’t the fact that I took it from LeBron and he’s gone now. Obviously he’s still around.”

> “The 15th year, this is exactly where he’s supposed to be at that age. So I’m sorry. I never looked at the age thing as a big deal,” Durant said. “I always figured at this age, [Michael] Jordan did the same thing, you still stay on top of your game. You get sharper. You get smarter. You know how to play and manipulate the game. LeBron has been at that level. This year isn’t any different than other year, to be honest.”

> “They have seen me play at the highest level and play against a guy who people say is continuously the best player ever,” Durant said. “I feel like I proved myself and belong in that conversation.”

> **“Accolades and accomplishments and legacy and all that stuff and how they mean to people, I can’t talk on that,” Durant said. “But as far as basketball skills are concerned? I’m on the same level. I feel like that moment was [LeBron] saying, ‘Welcome.’”**

> “Our journeys are different. We’re two different players. We have two different personalities,” Durant said. “But when you see somebody that is just as good as you are as a basketball player, somebody that you work hard to reach their level, you look at him as if you had a healthy respect and have that mutual respect.”

> “Slicktalking is basically letting your opponent know that you can’t stop him; letting them know that ‘Whatever you do, I got a counter for it,'” Durant said. “Trash talking is just trying to get in somebody’s head and break them mentally.”

> “You can’t stop great players. You can’t. I’m sorry,” Durant said. “You can’t shut them down. I’m not going to shut LeBron down to the point where he’s not effective at all. These guys have the ball in their hands whenever they want. They can shoot whenever they want. They can manipulate the game whenever they want.”

> “You want the offensive player to just think and second guess himself just for a split second. That’s what we both me and LeBron do to each other when we play against each other,” Durant said. “It’s like I know I have to think the game instead of going out there and letting my talent to take over. That’s what you want man. You want to be able to play a chess game.”

> “Everybody tries to prove their critics wrong or prove anybody wrong that says you can’t do something. It’s a matter of me telling you that I hear it and I’m trying to change how you feel about me on the basketball court,” Durant said. “Off the court, all that stuff I can’t change that perception on who I am as a person. But as a basketball player, I’m trying to change the perception of growing my game. If you don’t like it and I call you out on it, then it’s not my fault.”",579,Perksofthesewalls,/r/nba/comments/7m283x/mark_medina_kevin_durant_im_on_the_same_level_as/drqrrh4/,drqrrh4,1514249075.0,1514220275.0,"[Mark Medina] Kevin Durant: ""I'm on the same level"" as LeBron James",739,7m283x

MJ was 6'6"" 205lbs when the average G was the size of a librarian, his massive hands helped too and when you don't have to worry about help defense (since it was illegal the way it's played today) you could be aggressive.
