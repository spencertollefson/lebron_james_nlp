27,"I don't think he's lacking in the clutch department by any means (look at what he's done so far in the playoffs and over the course of his career), but I do think he's showing that he's susceptible to physical perimeter defenders. 

This series reminds me a lot of Memphis last year in the way that both the Griz and the Spurs have essentially shut KD down by simply putting physical guys on him that don't allow him to create separation and get open off screens. Memphis used the combo of Battier/Tony Allen and the Spurs are doing it with Leonard/Stephen Jackson.

So, what I'm saying is KD's apparent ""disappearing act"" in the 4th results from a combination of well-executed defense and a deficiency in OKC's offense. San Antonio is a smart, well-coached squad, and they know that down the stretch the Thunder do three things: pick-and-roll with Harden, iso with Westbrook and hit Durant for quick shots off screens. So they body Durant and force Westbrook to take bad shots since Durant can't get open, which also causes Westbrook to catch a lot of shit for being a ""ball hog.""

Now, if it were LeBron, then yes, he would be chastised for not possessing a clutch gene, but LBJ is going to be criticized no matter what.

James answered with a jumper and then picked Pierce’s pocket and ran to the other end for a dunk. 

>Soon after the two got into each other’s faces and were hit with technical fouls. Then Pierce spit toward the Cavs’ bench, for which he was later fined $15,000.

74,"It's hard to take the long view on James. Simple as that. 

When I read Bill Simmons' book something clicked for me as a fan. Crammed in those thousands of pages and footnotes are some basic truths that are actually in between the lines rather than the words themselves. 

I'm not trying to wrap you guys up in his thoughts about Kareem or Jordan, or Kobe. But instead, the other guys. I love that Bill takes the time to carefully pull apart entire generations of basketball with ""what ifs"" and ""could have beens"". 

With LeBron James I feel like we're genuinely watching something that shouldn't have been. Like when people bring up Len Bias, I feel like James is the opposite of that. He should have never been that good in Cleveland with such a crappy organization and management. He should never have won that many MVP's so young. He *can't* be on pace to unseat nearly every record of Jordan's except rings (but maybe not even that). 

Something should have stopped him by now. Some nagging injury that keeps him out and causes his team to miss the playoffs. Some feud. Some off-the-court incident that f's him up through no fault of his own. 

I think in short, everyone wants LeBron to be a flawed hero. So they can see a little of themselves in him. 

But they can't. He's too humble. Too nice. Too athletic. Too healthy. Too *good*. 

And because of that, no one. Not even Heat fans are okay with the long view. 

The long view is ugly. It means you have to consider *everything* about him as a person and a player. It means that LeBron could have a championship-less career and you still *have* to love him. Esp. if that career ends this season, or next. All of that potential we as fans wanted unleashed while he was stuck in Cleveland would turn into legend and lore that fans would naturally turn into fantasies. Except the reality is, he's here. He's putting up incredible numbers. He's even playing with teammates the way Kobe *almost* never did. Only he's not even living up to the expectations he's set for himself in some weird way. 

Like his game and his performance exists in some other 48 minute time zone and we judge it independently of the games he's actually in. But if you look beyond all that, and you think about where he'll be next week, or next year, or in 20 years. You'll start to get a fuzzy picture of what he'll have meant to basketball, and maybe then everyone won't go crazy about every little thing he does or doesn't do. Probably not, but I think we're all pretty fortunate to watch.

And all that still doesn't mean you can't root against him. I know I do. It's part of the fun.

LeBron James 'choking' in late game situations is not the issue. The issue is that he shies away from the moment, due to a confidence or some other mental issue.

To me, LeBron just has confidence issues, because hes so afraid of failing when all eyes are on him, he just doesnt want to be directly responsible for why his team came up short, because he desperately wants the media and the public to see him in a positive light. 

Thats what separates players like MJ, Kobe, Paul, etc from LeBron James. They never allowed a past failure to affect their decisions in the present.

The issue isn't the play made, the play was the correct one, elbow jumper in the pick in roll lightly contested by a PG is a great shot to get, and is significantly better than a double contested pull up jumper from a guy who is not great at pull up jumpers.  The issue is the play call.  James, Spoelstra or someone in the huddled needed to go ""James is shooting really well lets run an Iso for him.""

240,"This article reinforces why I think Woj, along with Ken Berger of CBS Sports and maybe a few others, are the best in the business. Lebron should have shot, and his supporters will rush to his defense saying he had a great game regardless (true), but it could have been even *better*. Imagine the love he would've gotten by hitting the game-winner or tying it up with a vintage full-steam-ahead drive to the rim. He's gotta learn to take risks; failure is natural, and for fuck sakes it's an ASG, not even important at all. On the flip side, people consistently criticize Kobe,  like those lovely folks over on ESPN in creating stats that apparently quantify 'clutch' play (such as John Hollinger), yet rarely appreciate the subtle difference between someone willing to take a shot versus someone who doesn't. Kobe misses, *a lot*, but he's not afraid to put the team on his back most of the time too, and whether his supporters want to admit it or not, Lebron is more than capable of this yet disappointingly in recent years has shown a remarkable ability of shying away from the spotlight down the stretch. I don't get it, either, especially given he's capabilities, such as when he led Cleveland over Detroit in 2007. He obviously has the *talent* to do it, much like Kobe, but has yet to show the kind of assertiveness you want from your best player in the biggest moment in the game. Do people still define Kobe by those playoff air-balls from 1997? Hell no. He's not afraid to miss, and this is something LBJ has got to be like in crunch time.

Of course, he does have to prove it in the finals this year. But I think it's his time. Let's not forget that Jordan didn't win one until he was 27 and Lebron James is...27.

I'm taking my team bias away here as much as possible and trying to channel the little five year old version of me who saw his first game in 1991 when Jordan showed me what the sport was about and [crushed the Charlotte Hornets](http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/199101120CHH.html).... so take it easy, if you will. 

That being said, I think there WAS a falling out in Cleveland- between him and Mike Brown, and Brown's inability to be what LBJ needed, and/or teach him ANYTHING he didn't already know about basketball. This schlub Mike, he rode the coattails of a superstar who put the team on his back and got a [Coach of the year award](http://i.imgur.com/uam1o.jpg) out of the deal. Then he gets handed Kobe Bryant and the Lakers? What are these people thinking when they make decisions, really? 

LeBron needed perhaps a [mentor](http://i.imgur.com/uCzgq.jpg)to help him mature, a [real coach](http://i.imgur.com/F8nmY.jpg) to improve his game, a [confidante](http://i.imgur.com/oYTrM.jpg) to share his joys and sorrows with, but more than any of that, he just needed a [strong male figure in his life](http://i.imgur.com/dI69f.jpg), to guide him in his absolutely epic journey. Especially at THAT time, seeing as he was trying to take his hometown Professional team to a championship fresh out of fucking high school basketball team coached by his [buddy's dad](http://i.imgur.com/s0VLs.png), with nothing more to work with than 4 other warm bodies and his own talent. You know, being raised by a [crackhead](http://i.imgur.com/wugPz.jpg)... an absentee one at that. 

So there's my notion of the reason he went to Miami- to be somewhere he felt safe and strong, with his [basketball friends](http://i.imgur.com/Rsw3R.jpg), the only other males in his life that had ever been supportive of him in terms of career. I think he's found the mentor he needed not in his buddy Dwyane, but in Wade's mentor as well- that OG known only as [Pat Riley](http://i.imgur.com/60mJk.jpg). Under him, the Heat are a notoriously strict team in terms of internal policies and player behavior (You should remember how they shit-canned [Beasley](http://i.imgur.com/1M1dK.jpg) after giving him plenty of chances to shape up or ship out), and honestly, it's probably what the young man needed, whether he knew it or not- [Discipline](http://i.imgur.com/PfBVR.png). That, and someone to talk to like a dad... Or, a [Godfather](http://i.imgur.com/aouFv.jpg), if you will. Someone who could help him be his best- to make winning a championship not seem like an insurmountable task, but to make it feel like a [game](http://i.imgur.com/a179w.jpg) again. 

Don't forget the spirit, joy, childish love of the game, and incredible prowess [***this guy***](http://i.imgur.com/xzctR.jpg) represents. That's not past tense, and it isn't Nostalgia. He's still here to watch and be awed by, to be rooted for (or against), but mostly to share what he has with the world- [Love for a sport he was clearly born to play, and that which he makes look nearly effortless.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPQJS_a85gg)

I slowly recognize the form and realize I'd been insulting Steve Nash (my far and away favorite player). I immediately tell the girl I've made a huge mistake and head over the courts, he's nice enough to let me shoot around with him and play a game with a few other kids who recognized him and decided to cut first period.

It might be different for you as it sounds like you're cheering for a player, rather than a team, but there is something to be said about watching an individual mature throughout his career. 

While I wouldn't go so far as to say that I believe Kobe Bryant to be a decent human being, watching him in games (where he's finally become something of a leader) and in interviews (surprisingly self deprecating and even passably funny), I admire how much he's changed. While I'm sure a large part of it is PR, it's still admirable how much he's aware of himself now and he makes a conscious effort to make amends for his past self. 

He'll never be a nice guy and he'll never be Jordan, but how much he's matured as both a player and an individual makes him a bit more human.
