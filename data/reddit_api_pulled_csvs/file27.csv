144,"#LeBron is packing. Debunking the Finals picture 

In this thread, I will use geometry and science to debunk the Finals picture. 



Height: 6-7.25 (2003 draft at age 18) Wingspan: 7-0.25


What we do know by these body statistics, is that LeBron has a VERY large skeletal frame. And proven by studies, height has no correlation with package size. 


If you look at this picture [Exhibit 1], you'll see that LeBron's arm sleeve takes up essentially 1/2 or even closer to 3/5 of his arm length. 


Exhibit 1: http://i.imgur.com/tVpQVts.jpg 


LeBron's arm length account for 4/5ths of LeBron's wingspan (Take out the shoulder width)


Doing the math, LeBron's arm length is roughly around 3 feet on both sides. His arms make up 6 feet of his wingspan, and the shoulder width makes up the rest.


Now knowing that LeBron's arm is 3 feet, we can then decipher how long his arm sleeve is. Knowing that the sleeve, takes up around 3/5ths of LeBron's 3 feet arm, we know that LeBron's arm sleeve, is roughly 1.8 feet.


I now want you to pay attention to this image. [Exhibit 2]


Exhibit 2 - http://i.imgur.com/oYAmXZo.png *NSFW*


Take note that the white square is the original sized image of LeBron's package. The copy to the right is an upscaled 125% version. We do this because we are going to use his arm sleeve as a size reference, and his arm sleeve is actually CLOSER to the camera, which distorts the size. This is why in bodybuilding contests, they have a marked out line which you cannot go in front of, as it distorts size when comparisons are made.


We then take the upscaled version of LeBron's schlong, and compare it to the arm sleeve, which is about at a 140 degree angle.

 
As you can see, it takes about 4 LeBron's to cover the shortened length of LeBron's arm, due to the angle at the elbow.


If we straighten his arm, it would take about 5 LeBron's to cover the length.


KNOWING that LeBron's arm sleeve is 1.8 feet, we can divide this by 5, to get the official size of LeBron.


It comes out to 0.36 feet, which is 4.32 inches


We then account for blood flow not being directed to the package, but the muscles. Scientists estimate that flaccid size decrease by about 30% during exercise, which means that LeBron is around 5.75 inches FLACCID. 


**This is higher than the global male average ERECT.**


We can assume that LeBron has at least 8-9 inches of Erect meat

458,"I've seen many experts rank him anywhere from top 10, to top 3 at this point in his career. I think the strongest argument in his favor is statistics. I'm not going to list them, because there are literally dozens of categories he is either top five in career stats, or top overall, but if you are curious, [basketball-reference](http://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/pts_career.html) is a great source. That is not to mention the 'only player ever' or 'first player since *some year way back when there were only 8 teams* to do this,' headlines he creates near-weekly. Last night was another example of that.  By the end of his career if he stays healthy he will likely lead nearly every stat in the record book (reasonable to his position). 

The criticism and perhaps bias when ranking him largely stems from two factors: 1. his overwhelmingly polarizing nature as an athlete, and 2. the narrative of his career. Jordan will likely never be dethroned as the greatest player ever, not because of his stats, or his contribution to the popularization of the sport, but because of the fantastic narrative of his career, that has only been polished throughout the years. (Three-peat, year off, come-back three-peat, space jam). Lebron has had epic seasons and epic comebacks of his own, but as I mentioned before, the guy is polarizing, some people hate him, and unfortunately losing 4/6 finals appearances, and going to Miami for four years gives people a lot to pick at. It also subconsciously affects people when they rank him. 

Sorry, that was a bit long-winded, but what I'm getting at is, if he actually succeeded at this comeback, against the statistically best team ever, it would contribute greatly to his narrative. People would quiet down for at least a little while about claiming Steph possibly being the best player in the league. He would have finally completed the most important objective in his career, and one of the greatest feats in all of sports - getting one for the land. Something about those satisfying narratives contribute far more than they should in the back of peoples minds when assessing the overall greatness of a player. 

So the stats are there, and will keep coming. With a story-book win like you suggest, I would not be surprised if some people jumped him up to number 2 overall, but at least top 4. I personally have him at 3, and expect that to climb one or two spots by the end of his career.

-Draymond, 2016

No truer word has ever been spoken in the history of the NBA.  Lebron James has always been a bitch and always will be a bitch.  He dips out when it is too hard.  He screams at team mates for his own missed assignments.  He is the ultimate passive aggressive social media loser. He shits on other people winning awards. He refuses to do the dunk contest for fear of losing to an upstart and damaging his brand. He surrounds himself with yes men and when he isn't allowed to do that he bails. He is a four time, soon to be fifth time NBA finals loser.  

Now, he bitches about foul calls?  This guy fouls on multiple drives to the hoop by pushing people out of the way with his free hand.  On defense he consistently holds, slaps, grabs, and pushes smaller opponents and calls it defense.  If he wasn't Lebron James, he would foul out of every game.  

He is the biggest front runner in NBA history.
