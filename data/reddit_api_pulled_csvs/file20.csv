468,"So much of Kareem's playoff success came about because of Magic Johnson.  Jordan would not be considered a goat if anybody could make a strong argument that Pippen was the better player.  You can definitely make that argument with Kareem and Magic.  

Growing up, the holy trinity of hoops was Jordan first, then Magic and Bird at 2a and 2b, with Bill Russell as the godfather.  Kareem Abdul Jabbar wasn't even in the conversation until recently.  

As for Lebron - he recently scored more points, rebounds, assists, blocks, and steals than anybody on either side of a finals - I don't think people fully realize how patently absurd that is.  Not only has nobody else ever done that or even come close, what it really shows is how thoroughly lebron has mastered virtually every single aspect of the game.  And he's done it while also somehow adapting brilliantly to an nba landscape that's completely different from the start of his career, while facing down the most lofty expectations and intense scrutiny of any athlete.  

Growing up, I was a huge Larry Bird fan, but even Larry Bird can't remotely compare, not running the defacto point, and certainly not defensively.  Consider that Lebron has been tasked with locking up both Tim Duncan and Tony Parker at critical points in a series.  Kareem couldn't do that. Hell, I don't think even Jordan could do that.  

And that's the thing, I watched all of Jordan's career, and I'm seeing Lebron do things even Jordan couldn't do.  So frankly, to my mind, as great as Jabbar himself was, putting him above Lebron borders on disrespect.  That's how great Lebron is.

469,"I think that it comes down to what you believe is most important - talent or accomplishment.

Kareem was incredibly accomplished, a great scorer, a great winner, a very long consistent career.

LeBron just blatantly is better at basketball. He's probably the best all around player we have ever seen, he can do everything on the court imaginable.

472,"Personally I think a lot of it has to do with people assuming LBJ will continue producing like this level for a number of more years.

Kareem was renown for his longevity in the league, and it looks like LBJ will follow the same path as him while starting as an 18 year old. Lew was 22 when he entered the league and was dominant until about 39.

 LBJ started becoming dominant his second year in the NBA when he was 19. He has produced at that same dominant level for 13 years now. He can effectively guard 1-4 if he wanted to. He is versatile enough to run the point but at the same time back down people down on the block.

Kareem was obviously insane due to his dominance and longevity, but LBJ is looking like he will have dominance, Kareem-like longevity, and unmatched versatility (better than magic) in terms of being a point forward.",22,,/r/nba/comments/639nj9/lebron_fans_who_think_lebron_is_2_all_time_what/dfsdwv6/,dfsdwv6,1491284289.0,1491255489.0,LeBron fans who think LeBron is #2 all time: What is your argument for him being above KAJ?,166,639nj9
473,"I personally have him at #3 behind Kareem because of KAJ's ridiculous amount of accolades and resume but I think the two main arguments are probably forms of the following

1) His advanced statistics suggest he brings more to the table. Him and MJ are The Kings of advanced stats because they both score efficiently, can rebound solidly, and playmaker for teammates well. They also have solid steal/block numbers and just do  everything really, really well. In particular they're playmaking makes them more valuable. 

2) As time goes on basketball players have gotten better, bigger, stronger, faster and more athletic due to more information, the increased popularity/internationalization of the sport and better trainers/nutritionists, etc;  I mean anyone who argues that we don't have the most talented league of all time right now is just blowing smoke out their ass.

If Harden wins it this year, I think he's pretty likely to win another as well. Say what you will about D'Antoni, but he definitely puts his lead player (and even Jeremy Lin for like a week) front and center for the MVP award if they can play his system.

AD seems like another top candidate, but I think it's possible that he wastes enough of his prime years on mediocre teams that don't win enough for him to be considered seriously. Call this the Kobe conundrum.

Kawhi seems to have the type of game and personality that'll constantly be overlooked for MVP. I mean, the dude is great, and there will be multiple years he deserves it/gets votes, but media narrative is a factor and Kawhi tends to go under the radar on that front.

Watch when Lue eventually coaches a non LeBron team and watch him fail miserably. The guy wouldnt last a month in a euro team let alone as a head coach in the NBA.

LeBron will play great in the playoffs. But the rest of this team is old and slow, and some of them look straight up tired.

People shouldn't ""doubt"" LeBron, but most seasons, he loses (obviously most of those have come at the hands of a Western Conference team), but he isn't unstoppable in a playoff series by any stretch. He loses series', especially when his teammates abandon him. I just think this Cavs team is smelling more and more like the 2014 Heat, where I could see the supporting cast and depth be seriously exposed in the playoffs.

Can any of these quasi contenders in the East beat them? Who knows. But I would be *shocked* if they won the title over a West team, because they just aren't that good right now.

All I did was inquire at my local YMCA about a fitness membership there, and got my parents to help me lay for it. I started out by experimenting with different weights and machines, until I found the ones that worked well for me. My strategy is to go to the gym twice a week for and hour and a half each time. I start by doing cardio for about 45 minutes, then progressing to dumbbells and weights for 30, then a 15 minute cardio cooldown. By doing this, I have slimmed down, and built up some arm and leg muscles. I have not changed my diet much, except for trying to make healthy choices, like reaching for an orange instead of a cookie.
