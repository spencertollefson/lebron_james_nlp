333,"""LeBron will never sign with Cleveland just on the simple basis of how well run the Miami Heat organization is. Management plays a very important role; look at teams that have been successful for very, very long time. 

The Lakers, Celtics, Spurs, Heat, among others. Through various lineup changes and coaching changes, they manage to remain elite and respectable franchises for long periods of time, and even when they're not, their rebuilding stages are quick and very successful. Heck, the Spurs have been championship contenders for 17 years *straight*, and before that we had a losing season *once* when David Robinson was injured, not even mentioning how successful we are even before all that. The Lakers have won five championships in a decade. The Heat take players like Beasley and Haslem and Birdman and make them into great additions into their system. 

The fact of the matter is, successful teams like the Heat are this successful because they have excellent higher ups. The organization is dedicated to providing the best environment possible, and that's why they will continue to attract players with winning attitudes. Go ahead and compare the Heat org with the Cav's. They seem outright childish and incompetent in comparison. Pat Riley would *never* send a breakup note in comic sans if someone didn't sign with him.

LeBron was in Cleveland for years and not once have they managed to build a quality team around him. They have never been able to build a team that can still be successful even if he wasn't playing. I cannot believe that the Cavs front office inspires as much confidence as Miami's does. What are they supposed to say? *""Err yeah we have Kyrie, we fucked up on our 1st draft pick for some reason, and you should come back because it's your home and we can try again like the good old days?""*

Why would he leave an incredibly successful and healthy environment to go back Mike Brown and Dan Gilbert.""",31,InAingeWeTrust,/r/nba/comments/84n45c/a_look_back_to_rnba_in_2014_when_reports_surfaced/dvqrfxd/,dvqrfxd,1521155640.0,1521126840.0,"A look back to r/nba in 2014, when reports surfaced that the Cavs would hold off extension talks with Luol Deng in favor of going after Lebron James in free agency",155,84n45c

Gotta force a tough shot.” He proceeds to dribble a bit then throw up an off balance one legged fadeaway, to which the announcers said, “Good D, no way he makes that.” Right after the swish sounds, they just shut up. After like 5 secs of silence, they were like, “You just gotta tip your hat off and focus on the next play.” The very next play, he makes an even more retarded, defended, off balance one legged jumper.

Noted a couple of interesting things: 

- Losing record only against GSW, HOU, NOP (1 game), Pacers, Spurs, Raptors (1 game)
- When they win, their average score is 105, when they lose, their average score is 115
- The previous stat continues for GSW & Rockets, nearly the same numbers as well (~105 in wins/ ~115 in losses)

*edit: below I said some only play 1 time, I was wrong (silly me):
