* He is turning 33 years old in a few days.

* He is in his 15th season in the NBA.

* He leads the league in minutes.

* He leads the league in PER, VORP, BPM, and WS.

* He is averaging career highs in assists, FG%, 3FG%, FT%, and blocks.

* He is shooting nearly 8% over his career FG average, 7% over his career 3PT average, and **10%** over his career eFG average.

* All but six other members of his 2003 draft class have retired, most from *old age*. One is a bald head coach. Most of the other six active players are creaky sixth men.

He is like Karl Malone if Karl Malone were *also* an Olympic track star. There is no physical comparison for LeBron's longevity and productivity. There are only 450 players in the NBA. The talent level has been honed razor thin.

That bench celebration when JR got that steal, and then Lebron hit that spin move and-one and K Love was on the floor in the fetal position just absolutely screaming. Then Kyle Korver came over and tried to calm him down, crouching right next to Kevin and whispering in his ear 'it's okay Kevin, it's okay' and the whole Cavs bench was fighting back tears because Kevin wasn't okay. They had to stop play because Kevin wouldn't stop hugging his knees and dry heaving. IT tried to get him to drink some water but Kevin kept spitting it out all over the Wizard's floor. That's when Lebron came over and picked up Kevin. In Lebron's big arms, Kevin relaxed, nestling his face into Lebron's chest muscles. Lebron tapped his nose to make Kevin giggle. And that's when the rest of the Cavs players brought it in for a big hug.",431,soft-cookie,/r/nba/comments/7khvv6/post_game_thread_the_cleveland_cavaliers_238/drehm7m/,drehm7m,1513589208.0,1513560408.0,[Post Game Thread] The Cleveland Cavaliers (23-8) defeat the Washington Wizards (16-14) 106-99.

279,"No.

I didnt read the article. I will post another response afterwards.

Edit:
>Through 26 games this season, the Raptors rank 11th in pace with 97.9 possessions per 48 minutes. But it’s not just that the Raptors are playing at a faster pace. They’re sharing the ball more — DeRozan is averaging a career-high 5.2 assistsper game — which is leading to a higher team assist ratio and easier shots. The only real decline from a year ago is Toronto’s three-point percentage, which currently stands at 35 percent.Down from 36.3 percent last year.""

This is amazing. Big up to the Raptors.

>Time will tell whether they’ve done enough to get over the proverbial hump — aka LeBron James — and make the NBA Finals. If they can’t do that, all the regular season wins will mean nothing — regardless of what style they play.

307,"Being old enough to have seen all these guys in their prime excepting Bill and Wilt I prefer looking at the GOAT debate in terms of tiers.  Clearly to me there are three tiers:

Top tier is MJ, Kareem and LeBron. 

Second tier is Magic, Larry, Bill and Wilt.

Third tier is Shaq, Kobe, TD, and Hakeem.

You guys arguing Kobe over LeBron are nuts.  Kobe wasn't even the lead dog on his best teams.  It's not AS bad but sounds in the vein of claiming Pippen over Jordan.  It's ludicrous really by any metric, even though Kobe is among the greatest ever.

Within the tiers go ahead and argue however you want but LeBron is at worst third ever.  Maybe if the Legend or Magic could have squeezed out a couple more years or if Bill or Wilt had been a decade later they move up.  Bird at his absolute peak may be the GOAT for example, but he and Magic didn't sustain it as long so overall LeBron is in the very top tier at this point.  To me he'll never eclipse Jordan no matter how the rest unfolds, but he has earned his spot by the top.  Kareem is the greatest college player ever.

442,"LeBron/Harden IMO. Harden can take some of the creation burden off of LeBron and let him focus more on defense. And LeBron is still the best player in the game. Playing with CP3 has proven that Harden can work well alongside another elite playmaker, and LeBron is obviously better than Paul. From LeBron's perspective, Harden is better at the old Kyrie role. 

Curry/KD is a little light on playmaking, comparatively. Their off-ball game is awesome, but a lot of why they work so well is that GSW has a bunch of great passers to help leverage that. Take guys like Draymond and Iggy out of the equation and they're not quite as scary. 

It's easier to just find defense/play finishers to fill out around LeBron/Harden than it would be to find the kind of Swiss army knife high level role players that GSW has.

926,"1. Freak of nature

2. clearly dedicated to maintain perfect musculature. The big thing that people dont realize about a lot of joint related injuries is that it is first and foremost a failure of a muscle group before a ligament itself. For instance, having strong but malleable muscles in the hamstring, quad, and glute will absord most of the impact and do most of the bracing for a knee on a 50/50 ACL injury. Most of the time, an ACL is from a failure of the hamstring to flex approrpiately to absorb impact.

3. Biokinetics. Lebrons running action, jumping and landing actions, and side to side actions are all really finely tuned. For instance, in his side to side shuffle on defense his feet never cross over each other, and when he turns corners he starts the turn at the hips and the shoulders before pivoting on his knee, most major knee injuries are from the twisting action rather than the front-to-back impact on the ligament.
