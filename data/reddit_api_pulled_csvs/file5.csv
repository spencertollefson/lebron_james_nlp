The other thing was I think they were close to dead even in TS a season or two ago, but lebron has jumped ahead a lot with how efficient he’s been recently. I wonder how his efficiency will fare as he transitions to old man game. Old man Jordan didn’t give a fuck and was still just launching shots tanking the shit out of his efficiency in Washington. Also crazy to think that next year lebron will be 34, which is the age that Michael retired for the second time. When talking about potential goat status for lebron, I think people really underestimate Lebrons longevity argument. He’s about to pass the 30k/8k/8k mark, Jordan finished with 32k/6k/5k.

128,"As someone who watched years of the team who launched more 3s than anyone else, subbing in and out shooters like an assembly line, I can definitely confirm that 3pt% for the most part never change that much. If anything, Harden benefited a lot more when the Rockets stopped playing 2-big lineups and non-shooting guards like Brewer, than the other way around.

I think the effect is two fold. One, yes playing with a superstar gets a shooter more looks. But on the flip side, a shooter is expected to take more 3s and tougher 3s because the point of having a shooter is negated if you don't shoot. Hence players can't just pick his spots and only shoot corner 3s or open 3s. If you're in a system with someone like LeBron, you simply can't not shoot. So the two balance each other out although overall the offense improves.",36,bauboish,/r/nba/comments/7wy8os/oc_does_playing_with_lebron_make_you_a_better_3pt/du43kus/,du43kus,1518438657.0,1518409857.0,[OC] Does playing with LeBron make you a better 3PT shooter?

Wade has the ball at the top of the key in the 4th, dribbling the clock down to 10 seconds. LeBron switches onto him after JR Smith walks over to talk to a Instagram thot on the sidelines. Wade calls for the ISO against LeBron, staring him down the whole time. As the clock winds down, Wade starts to mutter something to LeBron, “This is for 2011, you choking, receding hairline having bitch”. Clock is down to 2 seconds, He unleashes a fadeaway jumper from the free throw line over LeBron. The entire stadium becomes silent, since it’s the 4th quarter Heat fans have finally arrived to fill the stadium. The ball makes a clean swish through the net, the entire crowd goes wild, Chris Bosh starts to cry on the sideline. The entire stadium begins to chant “Wade County”, D Wade hugs his long time friend and teammate Udonis Haslem. Spoelstra instantly files for retirement for no moment can be greater than this.

Dan Gilbert should have been doing anything he could to repair their personal relationship from the second LeBron got back.  Instead Gilbert, after getting insanely lucky to have the best player since Jordan born near where his team is located, will have driven LeBron off twice.  LeBron made it pretty clear in that 'chilling at the barbershop' video a while back that he never got over the letter and still held great animosity towards Gilbert.

Can LeBron be petty and passive aggressive, and probably make it somewhat harder to run a team? Sure. I don't particularly love LeBron myself.  But those excuses will look pretty dumb looking back on them in twenty years.

Gilbert should have publicly disowned the letter by printing out a copy, going on live TV, tearing it up and eating it when LeBron re-signed. And yes i know that Clevelanders actually liked the letter for the most part, and I totally get that, but like I said -- it's going to feel pretty stupid in twenty years looking back like ""Damn he drove off LeBron -- twice.""

Only WCS will be up for a contract that's not a rookie deal.  

We know you love to have an influence on major decisions.  We like having our players doing that too.  Our GM is a former player for fucks sake!  You could run the show after your done if you want to.

We also know your image and legacy mean a lot to you.  Remember how awesome it was to be the guy that brought a city it's first ring?  How awesome would it be to be the guy that did that for 2 cities? You would be the King of the Kings and effectively own the hearts of cities across the land.

**Step 1:** Ron Jaworski goes on SportsCenter Wednesday at a little after noon and says something absolutely ridiculous: ""I truly believe Colin Kaepernick could be one of the greatest quarterbacks ever.""

**Step 2:** SportsCenter replays that clip less than an hour later. ""Strong words from Jaws!""

**Step 3:** A reporter at 49ers camp asks Colin Kaepernick, ""Ron Jaworski said today he thought you could be the greatest quarterback of all-time, the best quarterback ever. How do you deal with praise and stuff in this off-season and what not?"" That full question—and Kaepernick's response—are later broadcast on SportsCenter.

**Step 4:** Steve Levy goes on the 11 p.m. SportsCenter and talks about what Jaworski had to say.

**Step 5:** Steve Young comes on SportsCenter to do a spot on Jaws's opinion.

**Step 6:** San Francisco's ABC affiliate does a segment dedicated to it. ABC and ESPN are both owned by Disney.

**Step 7:** SportsCenter replays Jaws's hot take several times overnight. SportsCenter anchor Jonathan Coachman reports that Kaepernick is ""humbly appreciative of all this greatest-ever talk."" All this greatest-ever talk.

**Step 8:** The AP writes up a story about Jaworski's take. (So does SI.)

**Step 9:** ESPN picks up the AP story.

**Step 10:** ESPN puts the AP story on the front page of ESPN.com with the headline, ""Jaworski praises Colin Kaepernick.""

**Step 11**: ESPN Radio's Mike Golic plays the clip and dedicates one of his first segments to it on Thursday morning.

**Step 12:** A topic for the morning SportsCenter. ""Jaws made a little bit of news yesterday!"" Jaworski comes on with Adam Schefter to talk about what he said. And then Jaworski says that Kaepernick answered the question—that is, a question from the reporter about Jaworski's take—perfectly.

**Step 13:** Jaws goes on another edition of SportsCenter. ""I'm going to stick to what I said!"" he said, laughing hysterically.

**Step 14:** Jaworski goes on First Take to talk about it with Skip Bayless. ""You put it on Tebow,"" Jaworski tells him.
