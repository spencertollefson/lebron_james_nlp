Its like he is playing against his little brother. He doesn't need all the footwork that other guys have. I'm not trying to criticize Lebron, just trying to emphasize the uniqueness of him. When he goes to the rim, he doesn't have to mess around or try a spectacular shot; he can just bowl right through the D.

178,"ditto what the other 2 said... 

when he came in, they had him running the point for his entire first season. his game was much like it is now, except much less refined. 

Then: he stayed out on the perimeter and jacked up long, questionable 2s way more often than now (a la Josh Smith, but it didn't make you cringe quite as much as Smoove's). had no post game to speak of, but you'd be hard pressed to find someone better at slashing to the basket for the foul or the And 1 or contact basket with no whistle. Playing the point, he was 7-8  (and 70 lbs heavier) inches bigger than any other PG (or 3-4 inches bigger than the average SG that opposing teams would switch onto him) so it was a guaranteed mismatch every night because he wasn't much slower than other PGs, if at all. was a decent defender but not a lockdown one. hairline had yet to recede.

Now: developed a post game, a much improved mid range and long range shot, and much better decision making when it comes to taking what shot and when to take what shot. is arguably one of the most unique defensive players in NBA history as he can guard 1-5 on an elite level (although guarding 5s isn't sustainable over the course of a whole game if he wants to keep up his performance on the other end of the floor). Also, he is now a more efficient rebounder because he spends more time on the block and guarding opposing 4s... more opportunities for boards. hairline is falling back.

Both then and now: unparalleled athleticism, speed and strength. it's always been a double edged blade with LeBron... if you're bigger than him, he'll run circles around you. If you're faster than him, he'll bully you. you just can't win. his court vision has ALWAYS been bananas.

237,"> I know how LeBron James feels because our basketball careers were almost identical. In the 5th grade I rarely played on my intramural team that only won a single game and lost nine, that team was the Lakers. Must have been like LeBron playing for the Cavs.My next year, in the 6th grade, I was the starting center for the Royals. I must say that my hairless nuts grew so big that they split down the middle and one hung out of each leg of those very short shorts we wore way back then. We were undefeated going into the championship game. On that day of the championship, I soared like an eagle high above the gym floor barely missing the lights in the rafters. I was the star of the game and scored 12 points as we beat the Warriors 22-18. As we were awarded our blue ribbons for the championship, the tears rolled down my eyes. I looked to the stands and saw my mother who also had tears running down her cheeks. I waved to her very quickly so I could keep my nuts covered as they had now grown to epic proportions. I wore that ribbon on my shirt in school for a week after which my mother took it and put it in a frame and hung it in my bedroom. That was over a half century ago, but on that day, I wasn't just a basketball player, I was a champion, I was the greatest basketball player who ever lived. The following year in the 7th grade, the basketball coach asked me why I wasn't going out for basketball, I replied to him, ""I had reached the summit, I knew what it was like to be a champion and I wanted to go out a winner."" I had nothing left to prove and never played sports of any type again. I'm 64 years old now, and today that ribbon still hangs in my living room, still in the same frame my mother put it in over fifty years ago. Every day I look at it and say, ""On a cold February day along time ago, I was the best, I was a champion"". It has given me much inspiration through out my life. LeBron James is now my
equal, he has been to the top of the hill and seen the glory in being a champion. 
My Mother, Well she passed on just a few months after I won that championship but her last words to me, I shall never forget. She said, ""I will always remember you as being a champion my son but I will never know how you did it with that pair of nuts."" Then she died.
My grandparents raised me from then on. The end of that year, which was 1961, I was diagnosed with a double hydrocele which had made my nuts swell up and hang like apples inside of balloons. I had surgery which made my nuts normal again. I truly believe the size of those spuds made me play the way I did and would not have won the championship with out them. It was like losing a couple of friends after they got fixed. I guess the real moral in that part of my story would be, that if your nuts swell up and become emboldened, it probably isn't because you are good at sports and should probably tell a school nurse who would get you to a doctor. I just wish my mother had been alive to see my nuts after they were made right again, just like she saw me win that championship. Sometimes, I think it might break her heart, because I always had an Idea my mother was as proud of my nuts as she was of that championship ribbon. True Story.

Now something could be said about soccer players running 5 miles a game, something could be said about basketball players being able to have vertical jumps in the 40s, and something could be said about football players being the size of bodybuilders and running 4.5 40s.

I used to think basketball players took it, just because they were so tall and have such great hand eye coordination and just natural genetic advantages. When you think about it, especially guards like shump, durant, lebron who stand at just like 6'3- 6'8 would be HUGE wide receivers. Imagine a guy like dwight in the nfl, say what you want about him being a bitch but hes a big fucking dude and would straight dwarf at least 3 quarters of the league.

But football players, football players are just a different breed. When it comes down to it, the group of best athletes in football are better then a  group of the best athletes in basketball IMO.  There are just some freaks of nature in the nfl. Chris johnson, julius peppers, calvin, gronk, marshawn, those are just a few and I'm leaving out so many more. The strength and just sheer power is what gives the edge.

This all being said I think Lebron James is the best athlete in the world right now. I think he could honestly walk on any football team right now and play. And play at a very high level. I just don't know how well he could take a hit but he is a reallly fucking big guy too, so I dont think he would get ""wrecked"" like everyone immediately says when this discussion comes up.

396,"Its funny that we like to say LeBron, MJ, or any of the other greats in the more modern era would destroy that era. While that is probably true, we also have to remember how difficult he (and other black athletes) had it. Can you imagine MJ, LeBron, or Kobe being spectacular despite everything going against them because of the color of their skin? Racism was rampant, and thats not a great culture to develop in. For christ's sakes he went to a high school that didn't have a gym, and when they won the state championships, people were afraid of black people partying in town so they were forced to go outside city limits.

482,"This is Taurian ""TJ"" Fontenette, also known as ""The Air Up There"" or ""Mr. 720"". I was sitting courtside for the very first game after AND1 picked him up, and I said right then and there that he was the best dunker I'd ever seen. 

I'd heard that they'd added a dunker from Texas who'd blow my mind, but I was still caught off guard when, on his first play of the game, he caught a two-handed put-back with his chin over the rim and his knees on the defender's shoulders. I talked to him afterwards, and he seemed completely unimpressed by what he'd done, alluding to the fact that he was working on something special. Not long after that he debuted the 720 and the 360 Eastbay and took dunking to a new level.

Probably the most amazing thing I've ever seen from him was a missed effort, though. He was carrying a wrist injury that kept him out of the game at one tour stop, but at the crowd's insistence he put down a few dunks during warm-ups. After a few simple windmills, he tossed himself an alley-oop, ran down the left lane line, jumped off two feet, span 270 degrees clockwise, threaded the ball under his right leg and nearly managed to dunk it over his shoulder while facing away from the rim. He barely missed it and landed on his tailbone from about seven feet up, and it was still the craziest play I saw all summer.

509,""" 1.) This isn't the NFL, and ""

No, it's not the NFL.  It's the NBA, but size and power still matter a hell of a lot.

""2.) NBA players in general seem to have similar physique""

Similar **looking** builds, yes, but that doesn't tell the whole story.  You can have two guys who are both six four and 210, but one of them can be WAY stronger than the other, and that gives him a big advantage.  It's not that Lebron is THAT much bigger and stronger than other guys, it's that the skillset he has for his size is nearly unheard of.  He's got handles like a point guard, and dribbles and drives as well as a shooting guard or small forward, but it's all wrapped up in the body of a power forward.  It's like if Karl Malone was almost as quick as Jordan, and could dribble almost as well as Stockton.  There are a few guys who have better skills than LBJ, and there are a few who are bigger and stronger, but there is literally no one in the whole NBA who is *both* as big and strong as LBJ but *also* has the skills he does.

""LBJ doesn't necessarily look any more intimidating than most of the players I see. ""

That's because you're not out there playing.  In basketball when you see a guy his size, you say ok, he's big, but he's slow, big deal, he's Greg Ostertag.  Then, you find out he's faster than almost everyone else.  So you say ok, he's big and fast, but he can't shoot or dribble, so who cares, he's DeAndre Jordan.  But then you find out he can shoot and dribble almost as well as anyone.  That's when you start to realize how intimidating he is. 

If you're big enough to body him up, he can finesse you.  And if you're skilled enough to finesse him, he can beat you with size and power.

Who can stop him??

One on one, no one currently in the NBA can stop him.",60,toldyaso,/r/nba/comments/1m1zw3/is_lebron_james_really_that_much_biggerstronger/cc50o70/,cc50o70,1378788601.0,1378759801.0,Is Lebron James really that much bigger/stronger than other players?,69,1m1zw3

550,"Having ruled the Realm of Basketball for nearly two decades, Emperor James looks down upon his disciples and subordinates, eyes filled with satisfaction. He knows his time is short, and he must ensure that a worthy successor to the throne is selected. He scans the crowd's best warriors, and surprisingly, makes a very quick selection.

""You,"" he calls, eyes drilling into an unsuspecting pupil.

The young hero steps forth with eyes lit but filled with curiosity. ""Sire?""

""State your name,"" the Emperor says slowly, ""and you're allegiance.""

""Wade, sir. Zaire Wade,"" he squeaks out. ""Miami Heat.""

The Emperor's eyes nearly begin to water with pride as he reminds himself of his most capable general, now retired. 

""I have a task for you,"" James says sternly. ""And I trust you to deliver upon it, as I have trusted your paternal co-creator in the past.""

The young man's eyes betray his calm look, and he feels the excitement run through his very veins. ""Absolutely, sir."" He can't believe he is about to become the emperor.

""Wonderful. I would like to ask the greatest warrior on the planet to take my throne, and to ensure the continued prosperity of this Realm. I want you to seek out Chalmers, Mario The GOAT and ask him to honor my humble request.""

Zaire's heart sinks, and his face drops entirely. He is unsure what to think. Just seconds ago he'd dreamed of telling his father the news, but his heart aches now. A single tear rolls down his face.

Seeing this, Emperor James puts on a lelbron face and softly kicks his dragon's hide. The pair rise, and fly off into the sunset as the warriors chant in unison.

560,"I am AGAINST Lebron going back in time. My reasons are: 1. Lebron should stay in his own time and face modern day competition.  2. Life was hard for a black man in 1962.  3. He might mess up the space time continuum.

 If Lebron played in the 60's people would be really pissed that Lebron went back in time just to dominate.  People would be like, ""Wow, first you assemble the super friends, but that's not enough so you go back in time to a place where you can dominate the competition even more?""  It would hurt his legacy.  Also, he would probably need to grow a moustache before he traveled back in time so he would blend in better.  His whole look would change.  Shoes were only invented 15 years earlier in the late 40's and headbands would not be invented until 1989.

If Lebron went back in time to the 60's, he could theoretically travel back to the present day and break all his old/new records.  This would be unfair for other players who were only allowed to play in their own time.  If Lebron is allowed to play in the 60's then everyone is going to want to.  We will have no players left for the current day NBA, because they will all be playing in 1962.

I also worry about society in 1962.  Lebron would not be welcomed with open arms due to racial prejudice.  I feel like ""The Decision: To travel back in time""  Will be way worse than the first Decision.  People in both the past and present will be angry, and Lebron will have to start considering inter-dimensional play.  That opens up a scenario of Lebron vs. Lebron or worse Lebron vs. Lebron vs. Lebron vs Lebron vs. Lebron.  Mark my words if Adam Silver allows inter-dimensional play within 4-5 years every player on every team will be Lebron James.  Unfortunately, due to salary cap issues that means Lebron James will be unfairly making max money, while his teammate Lebron James is scraping by on the veteran's minimum.  Lebron is going to be toxic in the locker room to himself.

I also worry about Lebron meeting his own dad and somehow causing himself not to be born.  Sending one player back in time is risky enough, but as I said  previously, we would really be taking an enormous risk when half of the NBA travels back in time to the 60's to try and dominate the past. 

In closing,  I would really be disappointed if Lebron time traveled back to the 60's and hope he decides not to.",426,,/r/nba/comments/1l77wj/what_if_lebron_played_in_1962/cbwffsn/,cbwffsn,1377657294.0,1377628494.0,What if LeBron played in 1962.,74,1l77wj

566,"Alright, I'll give the first serious answer: LeBron only signed for 3 years after his rookie contract. It was pretty obvious that he was going to leave so no free agent wanted to sign in Cleveland longterm and we overpaid for the ones who did. Biggest problem was that we got too good too fast, so there was no young talent on the team that could have grown with LeBron. James also wasn't as dominant as he is now, he improved a lot in Miami. Don't forget he was labeled as a ""choker"", so not exactly a guarantee for a title.

Reportedly the Cavs almost traded JJ Hickson for Stoudemire, and Bosh to the Cavs was almost a done deal which would have kept LeBron in Cleveland. Bosh went to Miami instead and the rest is history.

581,"Methinks not.

Even with a very talented/well-built Heat roster and a playoff system tailored to determining the best team, winning a championship this year was no guarantee. The finals were basically a coin flip.

Suppose we've traded LeBron on the [Grambling State Tigers](http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/2755/grambling-state-tigers) for a box of Cocoa Pebbles. The quality of his supporting cast has plummeted. They are literally bad at everything. Defense, ball handling, 3s, free throws - you name it.

His competition, while certainly far worse, has not decreased to nearly the same extent. Take '09 UNC and '12 Kentucky. 4 and 5 NBA players in the starting lineup, respectively. More NBA players off the bench. These aren't scrubs. LeBron absolutely gets his against college MKG and Danny Green, but it's not as easy as you might think. He has no spacing. He has nobody to pass to. On defense, LeBron can't singlehandedly shut down a talented, well-balanced team.

In addition, the NCAA tournament is incredibly volatile. Even for historically dominant teams like '12 Kentucky, the odds of winning were less than 1-in-3. Even if you have a 90% chance of winning each game, winning the tournament is barely better than a coin flip. No team is a lock.

Rule #3: He didn't list any player he ever competed against.

Rule #4: He was able to sound like it was too tough to answer, players get a lot of heat when they list them without hesitation and miss someone.

595,"This is probably going to be a bit too detailed, but I'll bite.

I think I have somewhat of an explanation for Lebron's lack of Magic in the immediate top 3 that the interviewer asked him for. It seems fairly ludicrous that Magic (or Bird) could be behind Dr. J, but he also put him top 4 behind Bird, which is interesting.

Anyways, [I think a reason for that might be that Lebron remembers what Magic said about him before he started winning.](http://youtu.be/BzfZyJU2v6c?t=1m)

[Compare that video after the 2011 Finals to what Magic said after the 2013 Finals this year.](http://youtu.be/qVV78JJllzI?t=7m16s)

Back in 2010-2011 I was pretty disappointed by some of the greats' comments about Lebron, because it's as if they totally forgot the pasts of almost every great player, including their own. One example being [Magic's rough 1984 Finals and being hounded as Tragic Magic.](http://www.complex.com/sports/2011/04/the-25-biggest-fails-in-nba-playoff-history/magic-johnson), let alone the team switching greats like Oscar and Kareem did to pursue better opportunities.

It's always odd when people, fans but especially greats, don't keep in mind the career arc as opposed to moments. Many people, for example, have been sleeping on KD. He has serious top 10 all time, possibly even top 5 all time potential. But he was given some crap for going out ""early"" in the playoffs and ""not performing"" despite his best teammate being injured, Harden being traded, and averaging about 30 PPG for the playoffs with a nice rebounds and assists per game as well - and all of that with defenses loading up specifically against him. By that same token, It's not as if Kobe had the smoothest ride, either, and there as once a time LA blamed him for Shaq leaving, in addition to his ""he's too selfish to win"" period, the 'rape' trial, etc. 

One thing I've learned about the NBA: never write a negative legacy about a clearly great player unless they're retired and you have the entire picture. [That's why I respected Oscar Robertson during 2010 when he was asked to judge LBJ's legacy.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TrccDSAY58) He called it ""TV talk"" and said that you can't judge legacies until a player is done. While other all time greats were saying he could never be this or that, and he essentially sold his basketball soul and legacy, Oscar remembered his and other greats' pasts and predicted correctly that he'd be fine.

**END OF NOVEL**

As for the actual list, I disagree completely with Dr. J being number 2 all time. I do like Bird getting credit at number 3, although I may disagree with that as well. Bird was such an amazing player, and IMO should get as much credit as Magic as an all around player.",23,yurtyybomb,/r/nba/comments/1kt0k6/lebron_james_picks_his_top_3_nba_players_of/cbsg7n0/,cbsg7n0,1377139894.0,1377111094.0,LeBron James picks his top 3 NBA players of all-time,80,1kt0k6

Side note: My prediction is Miami resigns Lebron to the max, resigns Bosh and Wade to 'discounts', and goes after high quality free agents for cheaper bargains on the promise of winning a ring. HOWEVER, after this new contract is up Lebron is going to go back to Cleveland (Kyrie might be the best PG in the league at that point) and tries to win a ring with them. He does.

892,"1. Now that he's got his championships, as he gets older, he's eventually going to start thinking about his legacy; the story that he leaves behind after he retires. The one black eye on his legacy right now is that a lot of people feel he screwed over his home state by moving to Miami, and Lebron could undo all of that if he returned to Cleveland while he was still more or less in his prime, which he still will be by this time next year.

2.  Aside from Lebron, Miami has a core built around Dwayne Wade, who in many ways is the equivalent of a 35 year old, and Bosh, who hasn't played nearly as well in Miami as everyone hoped.  In Cleveland, he'd be pairing up with an extremely young all star in Kyrie, and possibly with a fairly young all star center in Bynum.  If you added LBJ to that group, you might still end up with a championship contending team.  I mean, if you look at the Cleveland teams Lebron took to the ECF and the Finals in his years with the Cavs, those teams were nowhere near as good as the Cavs will be by next summer.

3.  Bosh and Wade are both in the last year of their contracts.  If Wade suffers through another injury-riddled season, it might not make sense for Miami to lock him into another incredibly expensive three year deal.  It's possible the Heat might not be able to keep their big three together much longer, and if they end up having to ship Bosh or Wade out of town, it starts to make sense for Lebron to move on.

4.  Lebron grew up about an hour from where the Cavs play.  Kids in their teens and twenties sometimes can't wait to get away from the area where they grew up, but a funny thing happens sometimes in your thirties, you start to get nostalgic for your hometown, and sometimes you want to come home.",25,toldyaso,/r/nba/comments/1i24hx/why_does_everyone_think_lebron_would_ever_go_back/cb08nu0/,cb08nu0,1373547378.0,1373518578.0,Why does everyone think Lebron would ever go back to Cleveland?,51,1i24hx

904,"I think people forgot how good Derrick Rose is man. Some of the comments here are actually kind of infuriating. The Bulls offense back then was literally Rose creating everything. Other than Boozer, and occasionally Deng, nobody on the roster could score. People talk about Thibs as a top 5 coach (deservedly so) but he really lacked offensive creativity. Now fast forward a year, the Bulls are much improved. Noah developed into a legit option on offense, additions like Butler and Dunleavy (hopefully he can be a Korver 2.0), add a little bit of fire-power the Bulls lacked previously. Now Rose doesn't have as much pressure to score as he did previously. The Bulls just played a whole season without him and made it into the 2nd round. They beat the Heat in a playoff game on their home court. The defense is still there. Now add a dynamic MVP-caliber player like Rose on offense, I honestly don't see why they can't take the Heat to 7. I won't say they'll win, but I can say that they will be a problem for the Heat. The defense and physical play is how you approach beating the Heat, along with constant ball-movement on offense (which is an area that is a need for improvement for the Bulls). But surely, this isn't the same team the Heat played in the playoffs 2 years ago.
