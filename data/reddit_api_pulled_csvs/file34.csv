49,"I was going to put out some numbers on the Cavs 2015-16 cap situation but thought it would be better to do after the Finals had ended. Zach touched on it here so what the hell, here's some info:

If the Cavs bring back everyone on the high-end numbers the media has been speculating, and use Brendan Haywood's contract to add another piece, they would smash the Nets previous tax bill record. Even if players sign for what I think are more reasonable amounts they're looking at a nearly $100M tax bill.

It might be prohibitively expensive to keep Thompson and Love so letting Love go by facilitating a sign-and-trade might be something that the Cavs aren't forced into, but actually want. Doing something like an S&T of Love to Houston for Ariza and non-guaranteed money could allow them to max Thompson but let Shumpert walk. They bring back JR and Delly, use Haywood's deal to fill in another spot, and use the MMLE and would have the highest payroll+tax of anyone in the league but at least it's in the $170M range instead of $240M. If you get Delly for what he's really worth (less than the RME) and maybe don't use the Haywood trade contract you can pull that down below $150M.

The tax numbers get VERY ugly, very fast for the Cavs if they try to keep all their pieces together. They would get a big relief with the cap/tax jump the year after, but do you spend $80M to have Kevin Love, Iman Shumpert and whoever you can trade Haywood for in a salary dump or would you just prefer Trevor Ariza being added to this Finals team with Kyrie and maybe a Matt Barnes type or two?

I remember vaguely in the Chicago series (I think) Lebron being knocked down pretty hard to the floor. I thought to myself: ""Oh shit, he's down for good"" - 10 seconds later he is up and in the other end dunking the ball in the face of someone and Mike Breen or whoever announced ""And Lebron just passed [...] on the all time scoring list"".

The thing that people need to realize with concussions is that there isn't a machine you can hook people up to and get a green light or red light as to whether or not they have a concussion. If a player isn't honest about symptoms, they will probably not catch the concussion unless it was a really really bad one (where they probably would have blacked out anyhow).

255,"what makes him so great is he is playing at a position of Small Forward, but doing things that other positions should be doing, and he does them great.

He is great as a passer, normally a role of a Point Guard

He is a great scorer, due to his size, and athleticism, he can get to the basket easier (speed and strength) than others, because he can beat his man by being able to run faster than them, or if just being able to bully his way through the lane

He has great ""basketball IQ"" because he understands so many different parts of the game, both offense and defense, he can read what the opponent is throwing at him, and adapt/adjust accordingly

* Or because LeBron stopped playing like this and starts playing like 25ppg (still impressive, ofc). In such case, would we still say he deserves it?

I think it's fine to not double LeBron. Let him get his. GS has for the most part been choking his help offensively.

What they need to do is generate something, ANYTHING, on offense. They're trying to be too cute with their offense, running delayed screens for guys like Barnes on the wing. When shots aren't falling for your role players, you need your superstar(s) to just clear out and generate buckets. That's what you pay them for.

Let Steph iso against Delladova. Trying to run screens for Steph is playing right into the Cav's hands - Delly is good at fighting through screens and Thompson/Mozgov are mobile enough to shade help. Just iso Delly up at the top of the key and take advantage of his poor lateral mobility.

Also Draymond needs to stop pump faking on open 3's and then driving right into traffic (read: Mozgov). Either take those shots or GTFO the court.

296,"I don't see how double teaming him helps the Dub's defensive scheme. Particularly given that LeBron is operating from the post the vast majority of the time. If you double him with a guard cheating down, he kicks out to the open shooter and more often than not, James Jones, J.R., Shumpert, or Delly are going to hit a wide open 3. And even if they miss and GS gets the rebound, Cleveland has three guys back in position to defend the tranisition and Golden State will only have two guys in position for the fast break due to the additional guard that was cheating down on LeBron.

If instead the other big slides over to double team LeBron, it forces a guard to cheat down and guard Thompson or Mozgov. That is going to lead to easy buckets or FTs for Cleveland bigs as well as foul trouble for GSW. LeBron isn't going to panic and turn the ball over if he gets doubled in the post. Teams have tried to double him for years and its effectiveness is mixed at best.

The only way I really see this having a chance is if GS plays big and can use two bigs to double LeBron while having a sizable third guy such as Iggy covering the weak side of the paint to present some challenge to Thompson or Mozgov when LeBron inevitably dishes it to them. But if GS does that, their offense will slow down and allow Cleveland to deal with the array of GS screens.",45,LordBuddington,/r/nba/comments/39gaz7/negandhi_lebron_has_had_279_offensive_touches_in/cs347if/,cs347if,1434065888.0,1434037088.0,[Negandhi] Lebron has had 279 offensive touches in the first 3 games of the NBA Finals..

Double team LeBron. At all times.

You'll get the argument that LeBron will make the pass if he's doubled - well guess what - he's already making the pass over 10 times per game. They aren't stopping him the way they play him now.

You need to double him, and FORCE him to thread needles and make split-second decisions. Let Iman Shumpert beat you.

As it stands, he's just posting up for 20 seconds while he decides what to do with the ball. That shit ain't working.

Has there ever been a player, in any professional sport, who came into a professional league with more expectations and fanfare? LeBron was anointed a superstar while still in high school.

Impossibly, James has lived up to the hype. He's a two-time NBA champion and Finals MVP. He has won Most Valuable Player four times. Has played in 10 All-Star Games.

753,"The warriors let Lebron get his by defending him single coverage while flashing towards Lebron while sticking to the three point shooters, preferring to bait Lebron into going 1 on 1 the entire game. Brilliant play by the warriors because it took Lebrons teammates out of rhythm when he had the ball 90% of the time and shot most of the shots, which we saw take a toll when nobody else could make shots late in the 4th and OT. It is understated how hard it is to make a shot when you don't see the ball most of the game and it comes to you in the most pressure packed moment. It also wore Lebron down towards the end and he did not have much in the tank left as a side effect. This wasn't a case of Lebron going superhuman and destroying everyone. This was a calculated bait by the wars (sources around the league apparently stated before the game that the Wars might actually do this for the series)

That has been the Warriors defensive strength the entire season, take away the enemy team's biggest strengths by offering bait and getting them to engage in worse plays (the most common one they used was going super small and baiting the opponents either through pick n roll switches or just straight up offering openings for opponents to post up Draymond, Iggy, or Harrison, not realizing they cannot actually get them to budge because they are deceptively strong. At the same time the Wars defenders will flash help and recover back onto their man so that the guy posting up does not have easy passes out of the post and has to settle for a bad shot or turnover.)

He’ll throw you down, beat you up and even when you’re knocked out, he’ll keep hitting you.""

He makes his teammates better.  He's more like Magic Johnson.  In 1991 NBA fans could reasonably believe that Magic Johnson was the GOAT, since everyone before that time built their stats against weaker less athletic players.  I remember after his AIDS announcement, people argued that point.  And then Jordan won 6 rings, as the most individually skilled and driven player the league has every seen.  By 2000, everyone knew Jordan was the GOAT.  

Now we have the same argument 15 years later.  LeBron is the most physically gifted player of his era.  He makes his teammates better.  Kobe is perhaps the most driven and individually skilled player since Jordan.  Kobe has 5, Lebron has 2, and Kobe's window is all but closed.
