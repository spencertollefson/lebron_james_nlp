111,"""LeBron will never sign with Cleveland just on the simple basis of how well run the Miami Heat organization is. Management plays a very important role; look at teams that have been successful for very, very long time. 

The Lakers, Celtics, Spurs, Heat, among others. Through various lineup changes and coaching changes, they manage to remain elite and respectable franchises for long periods of time, and even when they're not, their rebuilding stages are quick and very successful. Heck, the Spurs have been championship contenders for 17 years *straight*, and before that we had a losing season *once* when David Robinson was injured, not even mentioning how successful we are even before all that. The Lakers have won five championships in a decade. The Heat take players like Beasley and Haslem and Birdman and make them into great additions into their system. 

The fact of the matter is, successful teams like the Heat are this successful because they have excellent higher ups. The organization is dedicated to providing the best environment possible, and that's why they will continue to attract players with winning attitudes. Go ahead and compare the Heat org with the Cav's. They seem outright childish and incompetent in comparison. Pat Riley would *never* send a breakup note in comic sans if someone didn't sign with him.

LeBron was in Cleveland for years and not once have they managed to build a quality team around him. They have never been able to build a team that can still be successful even if he wasn't playing. I cannot believe that the Cavs front office inspires as much confidence as Miami's does. What are they supposed to say? *""Err yeah we have Kyrie, we fucked up on our 1st draft pick for some reason, and you should come back because it's your home and we can try again like the good old days?""*

There was that video of him yelling at his teammates this past season. And there are tons of videos him just being sick and tired of Dion Waiters doing Dion things.

Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson is another example. MJ is definitely the GOAT of A-Hole, hyper competitive superstar. But Magic Johnson is up there as well. Everyone always thinks Magic was this fun loving, smiley guy, but all his teammates and opponents know he was a psycho-competitor.

1242,"I think he's right, he isn't getting some calls. Still there are other players that could complain much more.

- Lebron: 11,3 drives per game for 2,2 FTA from drives

While:

- Dragic: 15,1 drives per game for 1,1 FTA from drives.
- Ben Simmons: 16,5 drives per game for 1,4 FTA from drives.
- Dinwiddie: 13,2 drives per game for 1,8 FTA from drives.
- Butler: 12,1 drives per game for 2,1 FTA from drives.
- Teague:13,2 drives per game for 1,2 FTA from drives.

I get that some of them are point guards whose contact isn't usually deserving of a call, but still. Lebron is the 29th in most drives and 9th in FTA from drives. He deserves more calls regardless but he's not being targeted or heavily penalized, in my opinion.

""I don't pick and choose what LeBron should talk about any more than any talking head should try to pick and choose what he talks about. To me, when I heard about that, it was like an unbelievable show of arrogance for a talking head to try to tell someone else if they can speak, what they can speak about, when and where to do it. It's just ludicrous. But to not have a feel for who this guy is…think about when he came into the public view. How young was he? And to this day he hasn't missed a step. He hasn't fallen off the ledge. He's been a brilliant example for millions of kids, especially of kids of lesser opportunity who haven't had the same advantages of others. And they see in this guy somebody who's consistently exhibited excellence in the workplace. It gives them a voice, let's them know that you can speak about anything. There really is a first amendment, and I can have opinions as a coach, as a plumber, as an astrophysicist, as a lowly reporter. I can have whatever opinions I want. And that's what's amazing about this. When you look at this guy, how many tens of millions of dollars he's given? Tens of millions of kids that see him, that are inspired by him. It's kind of like the Black Panther movie. How cool is that for kids to see that and have that superhero? Well, now, LeBron has been that for a long time. And for somebody to be totally numb to that and attack him in such a childish way, really speaks more volumes about that individual than it does Lebron. He's very, very special. We should all be very proud that we have somebody like that who's willing to speak about a variety of topics, and you've listened to them all.""

Everyone *knew* he was going to be huge when he was like... 15. He's been in the limelight since puberty. So far as I have seen, he's never done any of the stupid shit that young men in that position typically do - drugs, alcohol abuse, trouble with women.

He's the ideal role model, and he was thrust into that position when he should have still been looking up to his role models. It's incredible.

Add to that the simple fact that he came from absolutely nothing? He's everything that America stands for.

> The story is of LeBron James' failure. He was as bad as I could imagine he'd ever be. He was atrocious. Atrocious.

> Earlier in the playoffs we talked about how he was, I thought then, being brilliant in conserving energy early in games to be fresh for crunch time. Now I realize he was just being lazy.

> He competed pretty hard on defense throughout the playoffs, but not tonight. He was a dog on offense. He was not a dog on defense, except for late in the series when he got tired of chasing Jason Terry.

> I have serious concerns. You can't be him, with his abilities, and have one less offensive rebound than J.J. Barea. I'm not one to use stats like that to crush a guy, but I spent this game repeatedly rewinding my DVR and watching in slow motion. I studied him. I mostly saw him standing and watching. I saw balls fall near him as he did nothing.

> That's a severe gut check. That's a severe sign of a heart problem.

> We came into these playoffs with all kinds of questions about Bosh's heart. I would not question his heart now. He was wrecked by this loss. I definitely question, however, where LeBron's head is. He didn't play like he cared. If I were his teammate, I'd have a serious problem with that.

> I only talk like this as someone who spent the night rewinding the DVR and seeing LeBron stand six feet away from the play, watching. Doing nothing.

> As a thinking person, he'd have to be blown away at how average he was. Yes he had a triple-double in Game 5, but he could put up those numbers in his sleep.

> If I were Pat Riley, I'd bring in a psychologist. And I'd say hey, man, you screwed up. But it's over.

1381,"Since LeBron formed the Heatles with two of the other 3 best players in the East, nearly every great non-LeBron season has come from the West. 

Over the past 6 seasons, just 2 non-LeBron players from the East have made an All-NBA 1st Team: Dwight in 2012 and Noah in 2014.

Starting in 2010-2011:

* The [top 20 individual seasons by Win Shares](http://bkref.com/tiny/uVLXD) are 4 from LeBron, 1 from Dwight Howard, and 15 from Western players.

* The [top 20 individual seasons by VORP](http://bkref.com/tiny/ypFOC) are 6 from LeBron, 1 from Giannis, and 13 from Western players.

1999,"Some dude got absolutely shit on one of the threads yesterday for pointing out that Ingraham took aim at LeBron and Durant (over Trump's many white detractors) specifically because they're black.  Like no fucking shit.  ""Shut up and dribble"" has such a fucking terrible connotation and it's absolutely drenched in racism.  ""Your job is to dribble and not speak"" is the sort of attitude that has been driven to the forefront with Trump, it's not even *thinly veiled* racism, it's just straight up racism. 

How people can justify it is beyond me.  

EDIT: I will clarify for the good-faith inquirers.  Racist social policies in America were designed in an effort to maintain white superiority over African Americans.  Everything from [Redlining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining) to the [war on drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_the_War_on_Drugs) were thinly veiled attempts to maintain the status quo, to undo the progress put forth by the 13th amendment.  

So while Ingraham (however the fuck you spell her name) seems like she would levy a similar accusation against white celebrities, the subtext (and frankly, the way she phrased her statement) *seems* to come from a position of outight indignation.  The attack on their levels of education, the way she worded ""shut up and dribble"" (as if it was an order) points to the notion that she feels the place of a black man in America is to entertain only, and never to provide insight or social commentary.

It sounds fucking crazy to say, but the way these pundits (the fox ones) treat black athletes (including Kaepernic) is almost like ""your job is to play"" the same way they would tell slaves ""your job is to pick cotton"".

Correct me if I'm wrong, but this is exactly as how I interpret it.  Of course I could be wrong.  Of course LBJ and KD could also be wrong, but when you look at the history of race relations in America the picture becomes a lot more clear over time.

And if I'm wrong, convince me why.",199,Wilfs,/r/nba/comments/7y9bls/lebron_james_addresses_recent_controversy_during/dueli65/,dueli65,1518931016.0,1518902216.0,LeBron James addresses recent controversy during All-Star Media Availability,796,7y9bls

2002,"I wanna just bring up something. This lady is working for FOX, and judging from her commentary I am going to assume she is a conservative. Which is fine, you do you. However, I am pretty sure conservative are all pro-Constitution. I am quite conservative myself. 

You don't have to agree with what LeBron said about Trump, which I personally argue with what he said. Really though, you made it quite clear you didn't. In the process of not agreeing, you trashed the man. 

- You sat there and called him a ""dumb jock,"" who left high school early to join the NBA. Also pointing out, that LeBron James is a ""lesson"" as to why kids shouldn't drop out of high school. All of this is wrong btw, LeBron graduated high school and has a HS diploma. 

- In an attempt to make LeBron a garbage person, you just showed the clip where LeBron said 'fuck' and failed to show anything after that and label it as 'R-rated politics'. This is where you calling him dumb and inadequate to talk about any politics comes in. 

- As to respond to LeBron's response on this, you show the 2016 NBA Parade when LeBron and Cleveland won the Finals. You just kept showing where LeBron said 'fuck', like we didn't get it in the first place. You are really trying to make LeBron seem like an awful person, when in reality you're the awful person. This also came off a little racist. 

But damn, LeBron James is so right and you are so wrong here. On top of that, back to that pro-Constitution talk, LeBron can say whatever the **FUCK** he wants to say. Wanna know why the main reason you were after LeBron here? It's because he doesn't like Trump. Where were you guys when Curt Schillings was talking?

LeBron James is really one of the most kindest and charitable people. He donates millions of his own money, he builds schools in the urban Akron area, he is really good with kids, he is a phenomenonal family man. On top of all that, he is one of the top 3-5 greatest basketball players ever. What are you, the 106th best FOX anchors? I really hope your show loses viewers and FOX pulls the plug on you.

He married his high school sweetheart and started a family of his own.  He's been essentially scandal-free in a social media era where EVERYTHING eventually comes out.

Now in the later part of his basketball career, he's focusing on business interests in addition to his athletic career.  He invested in businesses that employ people in entertainment, marketing, food service, etc.  He shined a light on entrepreneurs in Cleveland who are up and coming.

2171,"First comment I have ever written on a reddit thread but after seeing this post I felt compelled to write something.

What Laura Ingraham said is absolutely disgusting, and should not be tolerated or joked about. Im reporting in from Australia, where we have our own problems with racial divides, but this completely shocked me.

I was sitting at breakfast yesterday morning watching the commentary from Lebron and Kevin in awe of the intelligence and articulation they demonstrated when answering some very difficult questions.  Their hunger to develop and improve themselves and their passion when discussing human/civil rights was inspiring. 

Like me, Laura Ingraham has received every advantage in the world. She grew up in a stable, white, middle class house hold, with parents that supported her and helped her receive quality secondary and tertiary education. I find it amazing that with all this, she still continues to callously and ignorantly tear down others. 

I think it’s great that there are so many opportunities in the sporting arena for people to have a platform to speak. Sometimes this can backfire in circumstances such as the ball family, but mostly it gives our athletes the ability to inspire and talk about important issues. I for one hope that our athletes continue to express themselves, and that as networks such as fox continue to promote such horrible content and rhetoric they see their viewership decline and their reputation ruined.

2274,"Takeaway's:

1. KD said LeBron and he are the two best players in the league - Everyone agrees about LeBron and most people agree about KD being 2nd. Steph is a great leader in my opinion to be able to have that alpha dog mentality and lead the warriors even though KD carries himself as the 2nd best player and Steph doesn't let that ego creep in - Kudos!

2. When asked about what they had to deal with as superstars in High school - Bron says the whole neighborhood looks up to them as the savior of the city while KD says everyone around is jealous and he was out there thinking about them and shutting them down with his play. Different thought processes.

3. About racial issues in America - Bron had his views like he always does and KD looked like he admired what Bron had to say.

4. Article about KD finding his voice after joining the Warriors - KD was very candid about himself and accepting the facts about himself. I liked how he says "" I don't have it all together yet but I am who I am, we all gonna mature at our own speeds"" Respect. 

5. LeBron talking about Social media instantly triggered laughs and KD said some good things but with his recent social media antics I had a laugh

6.  KD & Bron talking about how Bron grew into a role model kind of person and asking how he became a good husband and father was good. The mutual respect NBA players have for themselves is amazing.  

7. Bron asked KD about how he grew and again KD was real and candid about how he is still growing and how he wants to inspire people.

8. LeBron's obsession for his kids and the kids in his foundation is really something that is on display every time he speaks  about any issues. Props to him

Gilbert might not make money from the team directly with such a big luxury bill but all the sold tickets and merchandise probably keeps it a little closer to a positive

Not to mention with the cavs value currently being as it is probably north of a billion to sell it only means his property around the arena is valuable as well

2309,"posted this recently in it's own thread but, Bron will easily break the all-time scoring record. it will take him 4 more seasons:

1) If Bron goes off, he passes Dirk later this year. 739 pts to go. Bron would need to average about 28 ppg for the remaining 27 games of the season. But Dirk is still playing, and still scoring. If Bron plays in 24 of the 27 remaining games in the 2018 regular season, and averages 25ppg, he'll end up with 600 more points and have 30,812 by the end of the 2017-18 season. Dirk will end up with about 31,200. So let's say he passes Dirk in the first month or two of next season.

2) That brings us to 2018-19. Bron passes Wilt ""The Stilt"" Chamberlain sometime around the holiday season of 2018, shortly after passing Dirk. He also will only need 1,480 points to pass MJ. Considering LeBron has 1449 points already at this point in this season, it's conceivable he could enter the 2019 All-Star Game as the #4 all time leading scorer, ahead of MJ. If he averages 25.3 ppg and plays in 76 games, he should end up the 2019 season with 32,712 points.

3) In 2019-20, when LeBron will be entering his 17th season, he will need only 931 points to pass Kobe. Assuming he puts up 23 ppg in 2019-20, and plays 70 games (1610 points), he will end the year with 34,322 points, and pass Kobe before the All-Star Game.

4) He enters 2020-21 as the number 3 All-Time leading scorer, 2,606 points behind Karl Malone. Say he puts up 3,000 points in the next two years, passes Malone late in 2021-22, and ends that season with 37,332 points.

5) LeBron would then enter the 2022-23 season five years from now at 37 years old, entering his 20th season. He will need 1,055 points to pass Kareem, so he has the potential to do it around the All-Star Game. Regardless, he should enter the 2023 Finals, his 13th straight NBA Finals Appearance, as the #1 all-time leading scorer in NBA History, ending that season with 1400 points and 38,732 total.

6) Let's say Bron retires at age 41. And in his last 3 seasons (2023-24, 24-25 and 25-26), he averages 65 games and 20 ppg (3900~4000 total points).

- Phil Jackson was head coach of the Lakers

>

You dumb fool. Bron still averaged 24 PPG on 50% shooting during that horrible stretch. It's not fucking LeBron's fault that their newly added players was playing like trash on the court, also being cancer off the court. 


>

Cavs won 14 straight games and was 18-4 at around December, Bron was a front runner for MVP, then that midget came back and everything went to trash. Crowder also started acting up, not helping the 2nd best player on that team up when he was on the floor live on television, that's locker room cancer. Trash as fuck

>

Management made changes because Cavs front office still not more incompetent than the Knicks front office. They actually make changes and does something, especially for LeBron.  They took the cancer and threw it out like garbage, and bought in fresher and hungry young talent. 

>


Why are ya upset? Because Knicks are still a trash lottery team? Or because the last time y'all faced the Cavs, LeBron and them boys raped your unicorn and the whole city of New York? Kanter clearly still didn't forget lol

I wonder how his efficiency will fare as he transitions to old man game. Old man Jordan didn’t give a fuck and was still just launching shots tanking the shit out of his efficiency in Washington. Also crazy to think that next year lebron will be 34, which is the age that Michael retired for the second time.

2557,"As someone who watched years of the team who launched more 3s than anyone else, subbing in and out shooters like an assembly line, I can definitely confirm that 3pt% for the most part never change that much. If anything, Harden benefited a lot more when the Rockets stopped playing 2-big lineups and non-shooting guards like Brewer, than the other way around.

I think the effect is two fold. One, yes playing with a superstar gets a shooter more looks. But on the flip side, a shooter is expected to take more 3s and tougher 3s because the point of having a shooter is negated if you don't shoot. Hence players can't just pick his spots and only shoot corner 3s or open 3s. If you're in a system with someone like LeBron, you simply can't not shoot. So the two balance each other out although overall the offense improves.",35,bauboish,/r/nba/comments/7wy8os/oc_does_playing_with_lebron_make_you_a_better_3pt/du43kus/,du43kus,1518438657.0,1518409857.0,[OC] Does playing with LeBron make you a better 3PT shooter?

He has let his dependency on Ambien completely consume him. Just last week in downtown Cleveland, I went out very late to get some canned beans at the grocery store. I saw Wade outside, wandering around in the pouring rain, half naked. I said, Wade man, put some clothes on before you catch a cold. He said, I don't need to, I have my birds to keep me warm. I asked him what he meant and he sorta just gave me this look. Then he opened up his fly and unzipped his zipper to reveal a bird's nest down there, complete with mama bird and four small canaries. He reached down and deposited a sunflower seed kernel into one of the canary's beaks. I couldn't help but notice that the nest was mostly made of old newspaper shreddings. I grabbed the nest from his pants and ran home. I looked back at him only once. He was crying one moment, laughing the next. The last thing I saw was that parts of his penis were missing. I think the birds had been eating it. When I got home, I pieced the newspaper shreddings back together. It was the newspaper covering his last championship.

As the clock winds down, Wade starts to mutter something to LeBron, “This is for 2011, you choking, receding hairline having bitch”. Clock is down to 2 seconds, He unleashes a fadeaway jumper from the free throw line over LeBron. The entire stadium becomes silent, since it’s the 4th quarter Heat fans have finally arrived to fill the stadium.
