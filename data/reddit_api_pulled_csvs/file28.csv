Anyway, I digress. So there was that one play somewhere in like the 3rd, maybe early 4th quarter, Curry was trapped in a double team and had to sort of hook pass it over two defenders. LeBron got a hand on it and poked it downcourt, but then couldn't catch up and lost it out of bounds. My dad goes ""Jordan would never do that."" And I was like...what the fuck, Jordan wouldn't have poked the ball away and not been able to catch up to it? LeBron never had full control and he just couldn't get to the ball...but my dad scoffed because apparently Jordan would've been fast enough to corral it and score. 

It was just weird.

Edit: To further my point on lebron not being a player that is assisted to as often as people think, in the 2013-2014 Finals, Dwyane Wade only assisted to Lebron 3 times in 5 games.

My worst concern is the new SF stadium will turn out like Levi's Stadium -- full of corporate ""fans"" and just a shadow of what Candlestick used to be. Tickets in the new stadium will be insanely expensive and less of the real fans will be able to go. Plus, it's going to be further for those in the east bay and in a considerably more crowded area.

The problem is, his 2 primary cast mates are horrible defensively. Way worse than GM LeBron thought they would be. They're so bad that they are liabilities at times. The underrated aspect of playing with Bosh and Wade was that they both can defend. Kyrie and Love are hopeless defensively.

204,"Lebron essentially wanted everything he had in Miami to be brought to Cleveland. He honestly had the right idea. Love is comparable to Bosh using the stretch 4 notion. However, Love lacks the playoff mentality that Bosh had and is clearly an inferior defender. 

Kyrie Irving was essentially his Dwyane Wade. Someone who could take over games with Lebron. Someone who could also serves as aprimary ball handler. We have learned though that, offensively and defensively, Kyrie is nowhere near the player Dwyane was/is.

He tried bringing the shooters from Miami in Jones and Mike Miller but those guys are getting older and haven't panned out. JR Smith was a weak attempt at duplicating the shooting Ray Allen was responsible for. 

Richard Jefferson is a poor man's Shane Battier although he has been performing well in these finals. He was the guy who was supposed to bring senior leadership to this team and maybe he has done some of that.

BUT, worst of all was the contract they offered Tristan Thompson. Tristan Thompson was essentially the Chris Anderson of the Cavs. Someone who could rebound (both offensively and defensively), play some defense, and catch and dunk the ball when necessary. Thompson is DECENT at doing these, just like Anderson was, but they're paying him $13 million more a YEAR. The blame for this deal has to go on Lebron as he was highly influential in getting him this contract. Not signing Thompson and replacing him with someone similar would have allowed for a lot of more money to be spent on other role players.

Basically, this Cavs team is a mere shitty replica of the Miami Heat teams Lebron played for. He wanted to do everything he did in Miami in Cleveland but every move was essentially a downgrade.

206,"Magic Johnson played power forward his last year with the Lakers, bulking up and supposedly increasing his bench press to 300 pounds.

Michael Jordan played small forward with the Wizards.

The real decision LeBron James had to make two years ago was whether he wanted to still be a ""guard in a power forward's body"" or whether he would actually become a power forward.  If he wasn't going to become a power forward, Kevin Love was the right player to get.  If he was going to become a power forward right now, keeping Andrew Wiggins would have been the right decision.  It is evident what LeBron chose as his future in Cleveland.

Considering he had studied post moves with Hakeem Olajuwon, that decision might have been a mistake.  And I'm not looking back with hindsight, because at the time LeBron returned to Cleveland, I said here that I thought LeBron would eventually transition to be a big man using a post-up game as his offense.

The one weakness of smaller lineups is against a team that has a big man who has a post-up game and who can pass.   If LeBron the truck isn't going to crash into the Warriors defense driving to the basket 30 times a game, what other way is there to attack the Warriors?  I also think LeBron posting up would open up the Cavs 3 point shooters to at least attempt some shots.",41,jphamlore,/r/nba/comments/4msqpp/the_cavs_that_lebron_james_assembled_are_getting/d3y709y/,d3y709y,1465258127.0,1465229327.0,The Cavs That LeBron James Assembled Are Getting Clobbered,1664,4msqpp
207,"The real issue is that Lebron built the foundation of the team to primarily compete with teams like the Spurs, who kicked his ass in 2014 (and they had a lot of trouble with in 2013).

The idea was that he needed younger star level players that could lift the scoring production off of him, as he knew Bosh and Wade were aging out of their prime years. Primarily - he realized that they were capped out and wouldn't be able to build a good team with supporting role players.

The Cavs had assets, cap room, and existing players to have or acquire both stars and functional role players. Essentially, they have largely succeeded in doing that.

What Lebron (and the Cavs) did not anticipate was a superstar (or two) maturing right away into players that could play at his level. He knew the Spurs compiled an exemplary TEAM, but he still didn't anticipate that they had superstars that would be able to dominate on his level in addition to their awesome supporting cast. He thought he would need a supporting cast just good enough to allow him to dominate.

The problem is that guys like Steph (and to some extent Klay) can play at the level of Lebron. So can guys like Westbrook and Durant. I think he really thought he would be unquestionably the best player in the league for at least 3-4 more years. But that didn't happen.

211,"To review the moves of ""GM LeBron""  

1) Getting a 1st round pick JR and Shumpert for Dion Waiters 

2) Trading picks for Timofey Mosgov 

3) Trading Andrew Wiggins for Kevin Love 

4) At least approving if not influencing Tristan Thompson resigning to that big contract. 

5) Probably at least nodding or approving of Kyrie Irving getting the extension he did around the time he signed. 

6) Trading for Channing Frye 

7) Probably at least giving the nod of approval on the Richard Jefferson signing. 

8) Probably at least approving or overseeing and giving the thumbs up to the Iman Shumpert extension. 

The overall trade of 1) worked out in amazing fashion. JR Smith is better now than he was in 2013 when he won 6th man

2) was meh. Mosgov was useless this year but he was a huge piece last year and also had off season surgery. Nothing too bad or too great overall.

3) In many ways you could call this GM LeBron's biggest mistake. He like many just could not accurately predict how Love would fit in. Many thought it would be a perfect fit, Love would work marveously in the low post and be a great facilitator passing from there, be a rebounding beast, get tons of open 3s and show more effort on defense than he did in Minnesota with less offensive burden. Yeah, well that didnt really happen. At all. It turns out Love is exactly the opposite of what they need that is an inconsistent, overpriced, de factor stretch 4 the way he has been used, a defensive liability, guy who often isnt assertive enough and yet the team feels pressured to play major minutes because of his contract and status. 

At the same time, if Wiggins was on this team the story wouldnt be any different here really. Wiggins hasnt been a ""disappointment"" he still has plenty of time and I think will be just fine, but he hasn't been some impact player who would move the needle for them. Not nearly good enough defensively or with his 3 point shot. So in that sense you cant blame LeBron who knew the pressure was on to win now and the team isnt in a worse spot making that Love trade in terms of short term. 

But long term? Yeah it doesnt look like a good move at all. And beyond that there were ways to get far more value of Wiggins in a trade if that was your goal. You could have gotten a king's ransom that would have much more directly helped your team and its weaknesses. 

4) This is what it is, we all knew this was happening and honestly overpaying Thompson doestn really change all that much except making Gilbert pay a heftier luxury tax bill. Maybe LeBron overestimated what TT could be but that's not really a big thing here I think. 

5) Another thing I dont really blame LeBron for ,maybe he overestimated how important and valuable Kyrie would be to a team that wants to win a title but what else is he supposed to do here demand kyrie get traded while still wanting to win now? Not really an issue with this. 

6) Good move. Maybe you can say they should have tried to do more at the deadline but this was probably the best they could find and it helped them. 

7) Another solid move .The type of low cost FA acquisition that was valuable and they need .

8) This signing doesnt look so good but they didnt really have a choice. Shumpert was a big part of their run last year and in reality $10 mil per year for a guy you thought would be 3 and D isnt anything egregious at all. Shit just sometimes happens. Again, doesnt really affect the long term dynamics it just means Gilbert has to eat a bigger tax bill. 

Take aways for me 

1) LeBron specifically wanted to get JR Smith and nailed that. 

2) LeBron put some level of pressure for Gilbert to resign all their key guys and pay the tax. Solid work by him.

3) The Kevin Love trade was not a smart move by him. Didnt really help short term and certainly wont long term. If you wanted to trade him, you could have definitely gotten something more useful. 

4) Injuries also matter here. If Kyrie and Love are in the Finals last year for 7 games, who knows what happens. Maybe they dont win but it's not out of the realm of possibility. If that happens this discussion changes. 

5) Remember Cleveland was what 33-3 last year with their big 3 all playing. There was reason to believe this would be a monster team this year. It's just Kyrie got hurt and wasnt the same as well as Mosgov. Shumpert fell off. Kevin Love just didnt play up to expectations. 

6) I think LeBron has showed more decline these two years than perhaps he himself and some others expected. Perhaps he thought he could do more than he actually can now days back in 2014 when he was projecting things down the road. 

7) It would have taken a perfect team to beat this Golden State one. It wasnt impossible but it would have relied on Love being a real asset and fitting in nicely(not being a potential liability) and Kyrie continuing to develop and emerge with a more well rounded game, not get hurt and regress. 

8) I dont think LeBron's GM decisions outside of trading for Love are that bad which I dont blame him for that much. The Cavs roster and OKC's overall roster arent that different in quality and role players on paper. The difference was in defensive commitment and RW>>>>>Kyrie. Those are hard things to predict if you are ""GM LeBron"". It's just this is a superstar league and the stars the Cavs have arent good enough beyond LeBron. I dont blame the majority of that on him despite making the Love trade because the reasons for Love's decline and Kyrie's I think to a fair extent werent all that predictable.

236,"Spitballing here. He use to be super self-conscience about his reseeding hairline and would use the headband to hide it. I think he even wore an oversized band to cover more. Then he did hair transplants to help it a little although not entirely fixed. But I think he got so self conscience about it that it messed with his mental. Then I think last year or maybe the year before the headband fell off in a playoff game and he said fuck it and never put it back on during the game. Then there was a little media attention about it and he decided he doesn't need the headband and didn't wear it the next game.

427,"He's capable, but he may not have the same gear LeBron found in that game.  Anyone who watched that Game 6 will remember that James' complexion never changed; he didn't celebrated or even smile when shot after shot went in.  Bill Simmons was in the crowd and described it as such: 

> I don’t know what happened. I just know the shots wouldn’t stop going in. After about the fifth dagger in a row (he made 10 straight), the crowd started groaning on every make — shades of Philly’s Andrew Toney ripping our hearts out 30 years ago. If you’ve ever been in the building for one of those games, you know there isn’t a deadlier sound. He single-handedly murdered one of the giddiest Celtics crowds I can remember. Thirty points in the first half. Thirty! All with that blank look on his face. It was like watching surveillance video of a serial killer coldly dismembering a body and sticking the parts in the fridge. Only we were right there.

> You can’t imagine what this was like to witness in person. I know Michael Jordan had similarly astonishing games, and others, too, but not with stakes like that. This wasn’t just an elimination game. This was LeBron James’s entire career being put on trial … and it only took an hour for him to tell the jury, “Go home. I’m one of the best players ever. Stop picking me apart. Stop talking about the things I can’t do. Stop holding me to standards that have never been applied to any other NBA player. Stop blaming me for an admittedly dumb decision I never should have made. Stop saying I’m weak. Stop saying that I don’t want to win. Stop. Just … stop.”

469,"Yooooo, I have to say, I'm a 29 year old guy who freaking loves chocolate milk.  It's nature's energy drink!

The best brand I've ever had is [Rosenburger's](http://www.mcall.com/business/mc-rosenbergers-dairies-20141029-story.html).  They sell it in the local CVS two blocks from my apartment here in Philly.  So rich and creamy, it's so damn good!

Back when I was a kid, I used to use Hershey's syrup in whole milk, and I'd mix it up and then drink it with a spoon, like eating soup.  But from the glass.  I was weird.

Thankfully I just stopped doing the spoon thing at some point, and now even I make my own chocolate milk, I drink it like a normal, socialized adult human.

I like to order chocolate milk whenever I'm back home in New Jersey at one of our many famous diners.  I sometimes get weird stares, but I don't care, gimme dat chocolate milk.  Kids drink orange juice as well, but you don't give me no stares if I'd order and orange juice, now would you?

TL;DR - chocolate milk is awesome

577,"You guys need to go to the root of why the West has been dominate for so long, so let me give you a breakdown:

Before we start, know that the West was weak in the 90s, plenty of teams at the bottom making the playoffs with terrible records, much like how the East has been the majority of the last 15 years. Now...


1. Bulls break up in 98, Jordan retires, Pipeen goes to the west. 

2. Shaq went west. Instead of the Magic contending, they suck and the Lakers are contenders. Before Kobe went GOAT, they had Eddie Jones as an all-star. Let's say that's like Shaq going to a team with Lowry as the second mate. pretty legit situation. There's 3 championships right there post Jordan era.  This by far changed the NBA to what it is today the most. As others have mentioned, western teams that were good but didnt make the playoffs ended up with better draft picks that made those teams even better. 


3. The spurs, who were contenders ALL of the 90s, suddenly had everyone worthy of being a starter injured in the 97-98 campaign. Seriously, that would be like the thunder losing their starting lineup for the year and tanking this year. to put it in perspective, Grandpa dominique Wilkins was their leading scorer. the year before that he wasnt even playing in the NBA. That same year the Spurs were a top 4 team.  They then get the number 1 pick and get TD. 

Spurs draft TD and the rest is history. The spurs have had a long history of putting together great teams and the couple times they didnt, they got TD and the Admiral. Not calling luck... but pretty damn lucky. 4 rings post jordan


4. great players went west and good eastern teams had bad luck. Grant Hill going down ruined two teams that could have been great. Tmac went to the west after not being able to contend because hill got injured so much. 



There's other factors where the east just shit the bed, like Melo leaving for the knicks, which was a terrible move since his team had just made the WCF's... that trade gutted what could have been a great knicks roster for years to come. he should have waited till the offseason. the knicks would have stayed as a top 3 team for years in the east, but that's not in melo's nature since he only looks out for himself, which is ironic because if he looked out for the team, it would take care of himself. 


Pacers were the favorites to win the east before the brawl. Pacers choked in 2014 and then imploded, otherwise they likely stay a top 3 east team last year and this year.

I also initially thought he was coasting too when I was high off the first two wins, but it's become pretty clear that Lebron is simply focusing his full effort in facilitating the offense and being the defensive anchor that the team plays around. When this team is clicking and playing the way Griffin (or Lebron lol) envisioned with the pieces he's assembled, they're far superior to anything that Lebron could ever do on his own going full beast mode.

If his 6th consecutive finals appearance is on the line during a Game 7, with Love and Kyrie playing like they did in Game 3, you'll probably see the Lebron that doesn't trust his teammates and plays to win it all on his own. But that doesn't mean he was coasting before; he was playing differently.

tl;dr I don't think it's really correct to say he's using the Raptors as training material. It's more likely he's just trusting the process.

But back to your point, LeBron said that they didn't get there by him taking over games. They got there by spreading the floor and getting it to the open man, and that won't change UNLESS he sees that the team truly needs LeGoat.

724,"So many eye popping stats in this one.

Tim Duncan with the insane playoff minutes played. Scottie with 30 more games played in the playoffs than MJ (those trailblazer teams were better than I remember). We call kobe a chucker, but even though he played 1200 minutes more and 40 more games, only had 2 more FGA than MJ. Bill Russel and Wilt clearly had to be rigging the numbers to both have around 4000 rebounds in their playoff careers.

But the insane thing to me is somehow MJ is 19th in games played, 12th in minutes played, and somehow has the 2nd most FGA, 2nd most FG makes, shot 1766 free throws over a playoff average of 83% per game, and leads the scoring category by 220 points.

If so, Biyombo has fallen on plays like that. It happens pretty frequently actually. He'll get an offensive rebound, hold the ball for a while, go up and get hit like that and fall to the ground.

It's perfectly normal to fall like that when you have 2 hands around your neck/shoulders that are bringing you down.

I hope we move on from this LeBron flopping thing, it's just idiotic. Lowry probably had a worse flop in this game that is getting 0 attention because he's not LeBron. LeBron has also gotten fined in the past so he's not being defended because he's the golden boy of the NBA or anything. Players barely get fines in general.

LeBron is so strong that he kind of has to flop to draw fouls, or else it will just look like nothing. Honestly, everyone flops. When LeBron flops, it's usually a foul that he exaggerates so the refs see it. Also, he's gotten a lot better at not doing it as much ever since coming back to Cleveland.",93,DeKobe-DeBryant,/r/nba/comments/4kjp1t/bismack_biyombo_on_getting_tangled_up_with_lebron/d3fkkz4/,d3fkkz4,1463979265.0,1463950465.0,"Bismack Biyombo on Getting Tangled up With LeBron: ""I get fouled pretty much the same way and I don't fall on the ground badly""",1093,4kjp1t

Adding to that I feel that LeBron will win at least one more title, maybe not as the teams best player, but a 35 or 36 old LeBron with a Kyrie and Love still in their prime, or traded for other players that fit, who is prepared to take a pay-cut which would facilitate bringing another star to Cleveland, could win a title in my opinion.",573,,/r/nba/comments/4kd069/is_this_year_clevelands_best_shot_with_lebron_at/d3dzk8l/,d3dzk8l,1463854886.0,1463826086.0,Is this year Cleveland's best shot (with LeBron) at winning a title?,616,4kd069

> Years later, as coach of the Heat, Riley kept the spirit of the '80s alive by reportedly instituting a $1,500 fine for any player who helped an opponent up off the floor.

> ""During the '80s, you were a prisoner of your team,"" he admits. ""Free agency wasn't really free."" Maxwell volunteers the story of how in 1980 -- eight years before the advent of unrestricted free agency -- Auerbach successfully bullied the Pacers into rescinding a deal that he and his attorney were set to sign. ""The shackles were always on you,"" Maxwell recalls. ""Red threatened that he was gonna take this and take that.""

> And the 2011 Finals, which plunged a depressed James into two weeks of self-imposed house arrest and ultimately convinced an empathetic Wade to hand him the keys to the Heat offense. (""I looked like Tom Hanks on Castaway,"" James told NBA TV's Steve Smith.)

> But ask Union when she first sensed the depth of their friendship, and she won't hesitate in recalling a more private turning point. ""When Dwyane got full custody,"" she immediately replies. ""He needed someone to be brutally honest with. Someone who could share his joy and his fears about this massive change in his life."" 

> That's what happens when paparazzi discover Dwyane Wade, LeBron James and Clippers star Chris Paul sitting in a line ... behind Gabrielle Union ... atop an inflatable yellow cylinder ... during a couples vacation in the Bahamas. (Union, who conceived of the banana boat idea, failed to convince Knicks star Carmelo Anthony, the last member of the NBA quartet, to come aboard.)

> But then Wade takes a second to think. ""You know, yeah, we say love,"" he says. ""There's nothing wrong with men expressing love for each other, if you're secure in your manhood and who you are. So, yeah. We'll end a conversation with Aight. Love. Or, Love you, bro.

926,"The people in here trying to make the argument that Lebron has always been on stacked teams and only had to go against scrubs are ridiculous. Before Miami, the narrative was that Lebron was constantly carrying garbage deep in the playoffs. Hell, remember when he came back to Cleveland and people were doubting Kyrie's play and Love's play? He's made these teams better. He's made his teammate's play better and play smarter. The fucking mental gymnastics some people do is crazy. I know, I know, it's just some people and not complete cognitive dissonance but still.

 And no, the east hasn't had legendary teams in that time but there have still been some fucking challenging teams. No matter what, to make it to 6 finals in a row is ridiculous. We can speculate whether or not he would've done it in the West or if the spurs or warriors would've done it in East but it's all just speculation, and speculation is fun and all but variables have to be weighed correctly. What we do know is the man has got his teams to the fucking doorstep of the promise land 6 years in a row and that's bonkers. 

He just gutted a team that beat his old team in a playoff series and people are gonna act like Lebron isn't the supreme catalyst for the success of evey team he's on? And I know the heat lost Bosh and if they had Bosh they probably beat the Raptors, but people were still talking up how good that team was, how they were clicking at a high rate. They made some acquisitions after lebron that made them a great team again and they have a great, proven coach. It doesn't matter though, because they don't have Lebron.


I hope lebron wins the chip this year. And I hope he keeps winning and I hope people still keep saying it's because he's in the east and because he's had nothing but HOF players around him. Of course you need good players to win it all, but having one of the greatest players ever sure fucking helps and he's never let us down in that regard.

>It's all a risk. That's the beauty of it. Some people are just more prepared to take risks than others. ... But you have to know: What's my baseline? What's the worst that could happen to me? And that's what life is all about. Every decision you make, you're simply evaluating risk versus reward.

I'm trying to eventually get into a very competitive Master's program, it's my dream but there's no guarantee that I'll make it. People in my life are encouraging me to follow an easier path and settle for a more easily attainable career. Am I willing to take the risk?
