He may not win the championship next season but in the long run LeBron will have a true chance at a long dynasty if they keep all these youngsters together.

5 years from now LeBron will be almost 35 years old and likely aging nicely. Kyrie will just be entering his prime and Wiggins will only be 24. Anthony Bennett will be 25 and has *potential* to be a 6th man of the year candidate.

He might be flying on his own to Miami then Nike to Brazil.

They could do anything but if it is flying Miami-Brazil anyway it is probably on of their GV or even G650 which has range to go LA/Las Vegas-Bazil no problem.

My wish is that there was a Decision type show every year with all the big free agents. Say tonight we could all sit down and turn on ESPN at 8pm and have LeBron make his announcement and give him 15 min, then at 8:15 is Carmelo, then 8:30 is Bosh, and so on. Make it like college signing day. Who the fuck wouldn't watch this? (By the way, why doesn't everyone shit all over these kids for announcing what college they're going to on TV? No difference than what LeBron did, except that LeBron actually raised money for a great cause)

> The Raptors reacquired their own 2011 first-round pick originally sent to the Heat on February 13, 2009 (trade of Jermaine O'Neal and Jamario Moon for Shawn Marion and Marcus Banks) and Miami's 2011 first-round draft choice (lottery protected). 

The first 2011 pick (originally Raptors) became the 5th pick (Jonas Valanciunas)... but it was lotto protected anyways so we would have been able to draft JV either way. The only way we would have gained from this pick is if we made it into the playoffs in 2011.

The Miami 1st rounder was traded to the Bulls for James Johnson (who wasn't really good), ~~then traded by the Bulls to~~ eventually ending up on the Heat (the pick was used to select Norris Cole).

832,"Melo sees the ability to return to a team and city that would consider him a king if he just signs a contract, let alone the legend he would become if he brought a title or even a finals berth. He sees a cohesive plan, led by a man in Phil Jackson who loves what Melo can do in his/Fisher's system and will be able to bring in free agents to complement/supplement that. And he sees tons of money.

LeBron sees the ability to return to a city that is apathetic to its sports teams, including ones going on ridiculous four year runs with one of the greatest players who has ever played this game, and a team that has no plan other than to convince people to play for less money. He doesn't like the coach's system, which clearly taxes him too much, and doesn't like the owner's unwillingness to spend above and beyond even though LeBron is making their owner gobs of money, but that will keep him from maximizing his earning power.

Melo's situation has optimism swirling around it, with long-term outlooks being very rosy. LeBron is seeing that there may be better situations out there for him. It means the world for Melo to be in NY and for NY to have Melo, it doesn't mean nearly that much for LeBron to be in Miami and it doesn't mean nearly that much to Miami to have LeBron.

LeBron's biggest reason to stay is for overall legacy reasons. Does he want to be seen as a mercenary in search of his titles, moving from team to team? I don't think so, but the people that would view him like that would also probably already have that view just based on The Decision. On the flip side, with the Cavs an option for him, he could fix a lot of that bad will and if he led them to a title, could regain the reverence of a city, like what Melo is going for. He could become that same guy in a place like Phoenix that is starved for a major-sports superstar, or to a lesser extent, Houston.",255,goldielax25,/r/nba/comments/29wonf/stein_were_gotten_to_the_point_in_free_agency/cip7iwr/,cip7iwr,1404609728.0,1404580928.0,[Stein] We're gotten to the point in free agency where some teams in pursuit think LeBron is more likely to leave than Melo.

I think the NBAPA thing is a part of his max contract demands, but also not wanting to carry a team again on top of a discount. 

It may end up getting salvaged but it does not look good right now for LeBron coming back.  In some ways, why would he?

973,"I assume from the ongoing talk this means that someone (definitely LeBron) is signing for more than their cap hold.

So expect Wade and Bosh to sign early and LeBron to wait. If Lebron is taking the max this ploy gives around an extra $2m to play with in cap room. Depending on what Wade and Bosh take that could lead to cap room of $12m.

If I understand the CBA the Miami roster would then look like this

: Napier (guaranteed money),
Cole (under contract)

*Resign some players for less than their cap hold :
Wade, 
 Bosh,
 Haslem 

*sign 2/3 players with cap room*

Resign Lebron to the Max

Use full mid-level,
use bird rights on Anderson,
use mini exemption

""It honestly looks like Lebron is finding an excuse to leave with this move by putting all the pressure on Riley/Bosh/Wade/Arrison to make the sacrifices and right moves in what appears to be a can't win situation with somehow improving the roster. Put Miami in a position where there's no way they can upgrade the roster unless his two friends take an absurd paycut. I said it before but I thought that Riley press conference was awful. It's not how Lebron like's to be spoken to, almost appears as if Lebron is challenging him that if he's so good at his job then he'll find a way to pay Lebron what he's worth while also fielding the best team.
