MJ is #1 in my book. Unreal on both sides of the ball. One of the best scorers of all time. Incredible championship legacy and revolutionized basketball making it an international game. 

Kareem is #2. Probably the most decorated player of all time. Unbelievable longevity. All time leading scorer

Lebron at #3. You could even argue he's the most skilled (EDIT: *talented*) player of all time (and that's a stretch, but you could make the argument) but he just doesn't have quite the legacy, the legandary aura, to be cheesy, of the other two.

225,"This is one of those obvious things that you can argue both ways depending on your perspective and both be right.

Draymond did not just ""go for a steal"" like Chris Webber said, he fucking knew the Lebron freight train was going and put himself directly towards him.

And... Lebron exaggerated the contact. Does that make it not a foul? Does it negate a flagrant if someone exaggerates a little? I dunno homies. You fucking go full speed into someone chest like that like a fucking rhino, I don't exactly think that's a basketball play.

The old timers can say ""back in my day"" all they want. Well it's 2017 motherfuckers, people want to see basketball plays not chronic karate kicking offenders doing their best bull impression.

238,"This is why I'm so annoyed with the argument that he is still somehow in his prime. He's still perhaps the most valuable player in the league. He led all players in all major box stats categories in a seven game Finals against a 73 win team. No one disputes that he is otherworldly, a living legend. 

But go back and watch his second season in Miami. Dear God. That guy could have tracked down Giannis for a chase down block, dunked on Embiid with no regard for human life, guarded Westbrook one possession and Adams the next. I know his BBIQ has increased, but I think 2012 Lebron was the peak of a very long prime but now he is in moderate decline. It's disrespectful to him to say he's in his prime now.

246,"LeBron has many advantages compared to today's and future superstars.

He's one of the few prep to pro superstars in the NBA; future players will have to wait at least a year before entering the league.

He had the ball from day one. Most teams tend to ease in their rookies, especially now that we're seeing a glut of talent in the NBA. It's hard for a player to be the first option as a rookie unless you're on a really bad team.

LeBron is incredibly consistent. While he's not an explosive scorer as he ages, he somehow will find a way to get 27 points even with a streaky J and inconsistency from the FT line.

He never gets hurt for long. The biggest reason Karl Malone is second on the All-Time scoring list is because he rarely missed games while putting up 25 a night.",57,rattatatouille,/r/nba/comments/5oaa4y/discussion_topic_with_the_way_current_younger/dchtl3u/,dchtl3u,1484598013.0,1484569213.0,[Discussion topic] with the way current younger players are being rested.

318,"it's so hard to rank people one after the other objectively, I liked what someone else did where they ranked in tiers.

Tier A was Jordan, Lebron, Kareem. These guys won multiple MVP's, best player on multiple championship teams, best player in the league for an entire era

Tier B was Magic, Larry, Bill, Wilt: these guys have a lot in common, revolutionized their respective era, multiple MVP's, but never able to completely dominate, in part because of their adversary (though Russell might can say he dominated championships)

Tier C I think would be guys like Kobe, Shaq, West, Baylor, Robertson, Hakeem, Duncan (not in that order): Guys who dominated, but something kept them from being higher. Robertson only won a championship with Kareem, Baylor never won. Kobe had Shaq's shadow, Shaq had the reputation of mailing it in in the regular season (for instance, why was his best rebounding year his rookie year?)

That's just my two cents. Can we say that Michael Jordan was better than Tim Duncan? I think so. But what about Lebron and Jordan? So far their career stats line up as 30/6.2/5.3 versus 27.1/7.2/6.9. That's pretty close. In fact, 1.6 assists makes up for 3 more points per game. 

In terms of peak, I think Jordan was slightly better. From age 23-29, he averaged 33/6.4/6 on 30.4 PER and 59% true shooting. Lebron however averaged 28/7.6/7.1 from 23-29 with a 30.1 PER and 60.6 true shooting. 

So raw stats favor Jordan slightly, but in that same time, Jordan's offensive and defensive rating were 121-103, or a net of 18. Lebron was 120-101, or net of 19. Per 100 possessions, Jordan averaged 42.6/8.2/7.7, where Lebron averaged 38.6/10.4/9.8, so once again over these primes, we see that Lebron scores 4 less points for about 2 more assists, with more rebounds when adjusted for pace, and advances stats are nearly identical. 

Now, Jordan had 6 titles and Lebron has 3. But I would assert that Lebron has never played with someone as good as prime Scottie Pippen. Even 2011 Dwyane Wade was on his last legs of his prime. A Giannis/Kawhi hybrid with Lebron would absolutely destroy the league, even though Lebron's playmaking make him closer in play to Pippen to Jordan.

Anyway, we'll never know. Jordan seemed to be the better scorer, he was 6-0 in the finals, but also only made it 6 times, Lebron has already made it 7, and that could be 10 by the end of his career. Lebron's longevity is better, he's only played 50 fewer regular season games, and has already played 20 more postseason games (and that's without a couple nice sabbaticals. Both have stepped it up in the playoffs (Boston 2012, Detroit 2009, last two finals for Lebron.)

So, if you had to ask someone who they would want to draft on their team and have for 15 years (ignoring baseball sabbaticals and team switching) I really don't know. I grew up in the Chicago area but if you put a gun to my head I might pick Lebron.

568,"So people don't realize it, but basketball is in a fairly unique situation to have a relatively undisputed GOAT with Jordan.  When asking what LBJ needs to be considered to GOAT that totally depends on if your asking what he needs for some, most, or all people to consider him the GOAT.  I'll go through my opinion

**Some**:  Either win another championship against a historical team (aka if he beats GS this year) or another 2 championships as the best player (including FMVP).  

Jordan has a lot of advantages over LBJ legacy wise (dominating an era, never losing a finals, etc).  The advantage LBJ has is the teams he has beaten.  People that criticize (or at least say what Jordan did wasn't as great) Jordan claim he was lucky to avoid great teams that would have beaten him (like Hakeem and healthy Orlando).  In the finals LBJ has beaten a 73 win team with the unanimous MVP, a Spurs team with a top 3 coach and probably 4 HOF players (not including people like Mcgrady), and a team with Harden, Westbrook, and Durant.  If LBJ can beat a healthy GS this year (assuming they still look good) that will once again skyrocket LBJ's legacy and I feel will be enough for a decent amount of people to have him as the GOAT

**Most**: Win at least 2 more championships (as FMVP) with 2 MVPs, 3 championships (as FMVP) with 1 MVP, or 4 championships (as FMVP).  

Much less likely obviously.  This would ensure LBJ has either more MVPs, more championships, or the same in both as Jordan.  With the MVP/championships count even I feel LBJ's eventual superiority in counting stats/diversity of championships would propel him ahead of Jordan for most people.

**All**: Win 4 more championships with at least 3 MVPs. 

Basically impossible, but that is what it takes to be the undisputed GOAT in the way Jordan in now.  He would have more championships than everyone besides 60s Celtics and Horry, and the most MVPs ever.",107,wormhole222,/r/nba/comments/5m0361/what_does_lebron_still_need_to_accomplish_to_be/dbzr7da/,dbzr7da,1483578396.0,1483549596.0,What does LeBron still need to accomplish to be considered the GOAT?,63,5m0361

601,"Credit Battier, Miami's analytics team and ironically the Big 3 Celtics in pushing LeBron to elevate his Bball IQ to another stratosphere.    

Battier: A avid believer in sports analytics, always requested the advanced version of scouting reports from the Heat staff. When asked who else was interested in these nuances, he said LBJ.    

Big 3 Celtics: When LBJ would face those Celtics teams during his first stint in Clev, he noticed Boston would know all of their plays and KG would be shouting them out on the court. (Mike Brown Secrit Plays: Give to LBJ and clear out) During this stage of his career, LBJ was playing mostly off his god given athletic ability but realized he could enhance his skills.   

Fast forward to the first year of the Miami Era. After exorcising his Boston demons for the first time, it seemed like LBJ took a huge step forward. When Doc Rivers was asked what had changed, he mentioned his attention to detail and the elevation he made in understanding the game and its nuances. Said LBJ would call out all of THEIR plays this time and it was a wake up call that this guy was on an even higher level now.

Every great had a slightly different style and they played it absolutely perfectly. Not everyone has the same strengths and weaknesses.

Kobe was a master of skills. Footwork, floor spacing, shooting techniques, body positioning was his thing. He had a ridiculous offensive repertoire. His fearlessness in taking shots or driving to the paint made him a nightmare for defenders because he didnt care if a hand was in his face or a 7' body was coming up to block him. He was gonna find a way to make that shot (or just shoot that double-teammed 18' fadeaway anyway).

LeBron is a physical beast. Stronger and faster than most people on the court. He uses his size to constantly gain penetration, and when people flood the lane, thats when his dishing and BBIQ really shine.

Jordan was a mix between the two. He was obviously physically gifted with the ability to fly, but he wasnt nearly as big or durable as lebron. He had to mix up his skill and athleticism that led to the unstoppable midrange monster that was #23. Give him room and he drains it, play him tight and he blows right by you and the help defender for some classic high-flying Jordan.

787,"Molly: Hello everyone, welcome to First Take. I'm Molly Qerim here with our very own Stephen A Smith and Skip Bayless. To start things off, NBA superstar LeBron James struggles to uphold a bet and opts in to eat A BANANA after a piece of garlic. Is he more sweet than he is bitter? We'll start off with you Stephen A.

&nbsp;

SAS: *condescendingly relaxed tone to show he's calm* no..no.. it's OK.. we'll let Skip go first.

&nbsp;

Skip: *inhales and exhales before placing both palms on the table away from each other and leans forward* Stephen A.. you know I've covered Michael Jordan as a beat writer for many years. I watched the Pistons elbow him in the jaw over.. *sighs* and over.. again in Game 4 of the 1991 Conference Finals causing him to bite his own tongue. After the sweep, the Bulls had food ready for them in the locker room to celebrate and as per tradition, there was a plate of pickled Bogatyr garlic which everyone on the team.. *changes tone* including Phil Jackson.. *reverts back to original tone* was meant to eat from. Now as you all know, unlike the regular garlic from the video we just saw, Bogatyr garlic is the spiciest garlic there is. Michael being the winner he is, with the CLUTCH GENE that he was born with, with *taps his temple* THE PSYCHE that willed him into participating, chose to proceed with the tradition. He was not going to let his teammates down, he said *holds a finger up in the air* ""Look, there's a mountain top, and I'm- going- to climb it.. and take us there!"". I watched Michael eat NOT JUST ONE STEPHEN A... BUT TWO! TWO PIECES OF GARLIC and a quarter of another piece that Scottie couldn't finish, *little shrug* who as usual, needs Michael to help him succeed. ALL- WITH- A LACER-ATED...TONGUE. There was a basket of fruit there Stephen A! With delicious bananas from Peru in there, yet Michael didn't even glance at it after eating the garlic! *sarcastic voice and holds up his hands in feigned fear* Oh but you're telling me the great LeBron James couldn't even eat one slice of REGULAR garlic and lost to the temptations of eating a REGULAR bana-

&nbsp;

SAS: *interrupts while trying to look droopy eyed* Are you done Skip? I'm about to take it away from you.

&nbsp;

Skip: *sighs and holds out a hand* Go ahead..

&nbsp;

SAS: I disagree. *waits for a while*

&nbsp;

Skip: Even after what I ju-

&nbsp;

SAS: And here's why. 

&nbsp;

Skip: :|

&nbsp;

SAS: LeBron James is a superstar. He is a 3. Time. Champion- WhoDefeatedTheSeventyThreeNineGoldenStateWarriorsEvenAfterYouSaidHeCouldn'tComeBackFromAThreeOneDeficit... yes I agree Michael is the greatest winner there ever was. But Skip.. 

&nbsp;

Skip: *looks irritated as if he doesn't pause during his arguments too* :| ...

&nbsp;

SAS: You can't fault LeBron James for eating the garlic that was in front of him. *raises his tone* That is ASININE *lightly slams table*. IT IS ABSURRRRRRRRD *protrudes his head forward*. AND FRANKLY!.. *lowers his tone* ..it's unfair. 

&nbsp;

Skip: What about the banana?

&nbsp;

SAS: Don'tInterruptMeSkip! AndWhatAboutTheBanana? Did it ever OCCURRRR to YOUUU Skip? ThatLeBronJamesJustLikesBananasAndWasn'tTryingToRemedyTheBitternessOfTheGarlic?!! Did it ever even cross your mind that a SIX FOOT EIGHT, 270 POUND ATHLETE LIKES TO EAT AND THAT A PIECE OF GARLIC WOULDN'T SATISFY HIS NEEDS? 

&nbsp;

Skip: *normal postured, hands under the table, passive toned* No.. I-..I-.. I just think he deliberately went for the food that's known to cool off a spiced mouth. He quit and took the easy route out. Even Kobe 2 seasons ago after he tore his Achilles.. once bit his own upper lip trying to do the Mamba face and was able to resist a glass of milk after eating something spicy .. *changes tone* although it was chili.. *reverts back to original tone* but as usual, Kobe Bryant is the only one who can even be mentioned with Michael Jorda-

&nbsp;

SAS: WHAT?! THAT IS PREPOSTEROUS AND BLASPHEMOUS! IT WAS POBLANO CHILLI! YOU DON'T DESERVE TO TALK ABOUT BASKETBALL OR SPICES SKIP! *raises his pitch to the point it's almost wheezing* IT'S NOT EVEN COMPAAARABLE, HOW DAAAARE YOU!
