2,"ESPN now has their headline to breakdown for the next 2 years and discuss over and over again. 

I mean honestly if you're a writer for ESPN that covers the NBA you're probably beaming with excitement cause you can probably do an article a day on this for the next month until he signs with a Rich Paul.

At the very least you have...

* The breaking news itself that AD is leaving his agent

* The breaking news that Rich Paul is the likely top candidate to represent him now 

* What this means for the Pelicans

* What this could mean for the Lakers

* Should the Pelicans trade AD to Boston due to him changing agents?

* Will AD soon demand a trade?

* Does the Deng buyout set up the Lakers to not only get a max this year, but set up down the line for another max/trade for AD in 2 years? 

* Does a hypothetical team of LeBron/AD contend with the Warriors?

Every roster Lebron has played for with Lue has the same pitfalls, if Lebron isn't in, no one can get anything going, and when Lebron is in, everyone just seems to give him the ball and wait to see what he does instead of trying to make plays. 

When Lue was out, the Cavs went on a seven game win-streak, and after he came back the end of the season was very lackluster. Larry Drew is far from the greatest Head Coach out there, but it's obvious Lue isn't good.

452,"It makes me so sick seeing all of you /r/nba psychics saying that lebron leaving is a foregone conclusion. It’s possible, but I would say it’s more likely he re-signs with Cleveland.

If you all remember the over 36 rule, it (basically, and I mean very basically) meant that if a player signs a contract that goes through a players 36th year, they aren’t guaranteed the money after that year (meaning if they weren’t able to earn the money playing games). Chris Paul and LeBron were the two main voices in getting that rule extended to 38, which means for the 5 year supermax they need to sign it in the offseason of year 33.

Lebron is 33. He needs to sign a 5 year deal this season to capitalize on the increasing salary cap and secure an additional 50m+. No other team besides Cleveland can offer him this contract, and if he were to sign elsewhere he would lose the bird rights and piss away 50 million easy. No matter how financially secure you are, 50 million is nothing to shake a stick at. Sign and trades are still possible, but Houston, for example, can’t afford picking up lebron and signing Chris Paul who is also a free agent, without sacrificing a ton, to this enormous supermax.

Which brings me to my next point, why doesnt he just take a pay cut? Think about what extending that rule did. Bron is the vice prez of the NBPA and advocated for players rights, especially that rule, but if he himself were to take a cut, he is pissing in the face of rights and CBA statutes that he fought so hard to secure for the future of the league. It’s bigger than basketball, players put their health on the line to entertain us and are getting every penny and then some. Not taking the full contract definitely shifts some power away from players back into white collar owners during free agent negotiations.

Lebron is not the type of person to sacrifice future generations of players to chase rings that will never mean as much to his legacy as ones in Cleveland will. Which brings me to my last point. Why would lebron go win a ring with philly or with Houston when critics will just use it to claim “he has to leave to win, ring chaser, mercenary, he can’t get it done when things get tough. Jordan never left.” We know he is chasing Jordan’s shadow, and while winning additional rings might look good on paper, you need that and context to put you above MJ as consensus GOAT. Does KDs ring from last year weigh nearly as much as lebrons in 2016? Dirks in 2011? Kobe’s post-shaq? No. Context matters. It just isn’t worth risking your legacy when Cleveland isn’t your worst option at a title.

So here’s what we know:

At media day this year before the season started, lebron has said that his plan to finish his career in Cleveland has NOT changed.

He has never ever stated an intention to leave Cleveland again.

Financially and principally leaving Cleveland (except in a sign and trade, financially speaking) is not logically possible.

It could happen, sure, but it definitely is NOT a foregone conclusion. Everyone who sits here and tells you that he’s definitely gone or that philly is more likely than Cleveland has lost their minds.",32,gotmiIkman,/r/nba/comments/8elw1e/zach_lowe_on_the_cavs_if_this_is_as_good_as_they/dxx07bl/,dxx07bl,1524644634.0,1524615834.0,[Zach Lowe on the Cavs] “If this is as good as they are [it’s not enough].

I like how to some, playing next to Chris Paul is seen as a negative for Harden's MVP argument, and then Love missing a lot of games is seen as a boost to LeBron's MVP argument. Nobody seems to mention that Chris Paul actually missed *1 more game* than Kevin Love.

I get that Paul/Love play different roles and everything, and it isn't *exactly* the same obviously, but they are seen so differently despite being in pretty similar scenarios (star injured for 20+ games).

That was a politically correct answer and after hearing this, there's no way he could ever do that considering she would have to be a first time head coach. Throughout his career, he can only play for coaches he respects or let him basically coach the team: Ty Lue or Mike Brown. No way he could ever play for a rookie women head coach.

Maybe if there was a tenured female coach with a proven pedigree akin to Popovich or Jackson, but considering there isn't and she would have to be a rookie head coach there is no way. Lebron is a very picky diva when it comes to his coaches (which he has every right to be). 

I thought this before when he said it, but then thought back to Spo and thought nah maybe he can. He gave erik spoelstra a shot so maybe I'm misjudging him, but after hearing this I'm convinced.

I borderline HATE Isaiah and his team.  My freaking MOTHER hates Isaiah and his team.  And in a way, I don't even mean that in a sports manner.  

The absolute thug like tactics that they used against players was beyond any redemption -- against Boston, [Laimbeer once literally neck-tied and body slammed Larry Bird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHCeId9xiiI), he threw [Jordan to the ground](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V41lN-ou7FY), they cheapshotted [the sixers, starting a fight with Barkley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IE2e86u3gBQ), Rodman one time [kicked Scottie in the face](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBvPK7Mh4xk), while [also shoving him into the camera section](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhQyaKWsQy8), and on and on.  

And all of this was sanctioned by the leader of their team (Isaiah).  This sort of shit could ruin careers, and none of it was in good faith -- they just were literally violent bullies that got away with it.

These acts would be considered grounds for possible expulsion from the present league (hell, could you even imagine if someone did half of any of the above to LeBron like they did to Jordan or Bird?) but they were routinely either ""just play ons"" or, at the end, ""possible flagrants"".  

Beautiful play shouldn't be marred by clearly out of the line physical play like the above -- but Isaiah was at the forefront of all of that.  And when they *FINALLY WERE VANQUISHED AND LOST IN A SWEEP* what did they do?

They walked off the court without shaking hands.

What a bunch of asswipes.  It's easy to punch people in the face when the other team is trying to play by the rules and you know it.

1287,"I still stand by this: the whole discussion is stupid and a media fraud anyway. Basketball is a team game. Any argument you make for a single player (like going 6-6 in finals or making the finals 7 consecutive times or winning 11 rings or whatever) will have been impacted by so many factors: his team, the matchups with other teams, teams being eliminated before meeting the player, luck and much more

LeBron is great, Jordan was great and they are GOAT-Level players (with a few others) - any differentiation beyond that is personal preference and a way to sell copies or views

Just my opinion though

EDIT: okay, thanks for the upvotes, this is probably my highest rated comment on any account yet lol. I just wanted to take the time to clarify a bit for people who stumble upon this in the future. I was ranting a bit because i have a big distaste for most ""sports journalism"".

I have no problem with people in this sub or any forum or in a bar discussing who is the GOAT, i get it, it's fun. I have a big problem when people try to make it an objective fact, because i feel like you can't. By what measure do you do it? I mean the game is about who get's the most points, so maybe the player that scored the most points? but then again you win when your opponent makes less points then you, so maybe blocks? I think you know where i am trying to go with this, it's pretty hard to make an objective fact, because this is not 100m dash.

That's why i enjoy Inside the NBA so much (and i guess it's the reason why they are so successful), because they rarely make these kind of extreme hot takes (or at least not with one of the others trying to shit on them), and i feel like it's a lot more about hyping the current players as opposed to shitting on them and bringing them down. That's what i feel like happens a lot in these GOAT (or whatever list) discussions on TV.

And yeah, i have an opinion who is the GOAT and that is MJ to me. Because as a 1991 born kid in Germany he is the reason i got into basketball, because he was everywhere, and my older cousin was a big MJ fan. I might even have that old Bulls cap he gifted me when i was like 7 or 8 years old?

***so yeah***, ***TL;DR***: I hate definitive GOAT discussions in ""sports journalism"" (or any ""Top 10 X"" or whatever list they come up with). I feel like they use it much more to shit on people than to hype people, which should be their job. i have no problem with it happening in a sports bar or between friends or on here.

1486,"It's a good answer and it's the right answer. I firmly believe LeBron means it, and don't think it's PR speak (or at least *just* PR speak).

That said, it'd be interesting if he were to play under the first female head coach. Because LeBron is pretty notoriously tough to coach -- there are tons of stories, from him walking all over Mike Brown, to him ignoring Blatt, to him trying to get Spo fired... LeBron has clashed with most of the head coaches he's had.

Now, I think LeBron is media savvy enough not to do that stuff if he were to have the first female head coach. But it'd be interesting to see, because he'd either have to change his ""coachability"", or he'd have to endure a clusterfuck of dumb headlines about how he doesn't respect women, or how he wouldn't disrespect her if she were a male head coach (which he totally would, but people ignore that shit).",114,mr_showboat,/r/nba/comments/8a372r/lebron_on_idea_of_playing_for_female_head_coach/dwvhda3/,dwvhda3,1522989418.0,1522960618.0,"LeBron on idea of playing for female head coach: 'If you know the game, you know the game'",5484,8a372r

From what I see, I think everyone else in the rotation will run 15-30 minutes in the game and will acts as sparks. Besides Love, everyone else can be replaced by a bench player for short bursts of energy for the playoffs. Couple this with the fact that Cavs always run a LeBron/“whosever is hot, gets fed” offence, it makes more sense.

LeBron will take over a greater deal of the game down the line (as we’ve seen with his ridiculous fourth quarter takeovers). Whether or not this is enough for the finals is anyone’s guess, but it’s just my theory.

1663,"Last week, the official Twitter account for Alabama football released a trailer for ""Shop Talk,"" with Alabama alumnus Julio Jones joining Saban and other football players for an off-the-cuff roundtable discussion in a barbershop setting.

On Monday, ""Uninterrupted"" sent a letter to Alabama addressing concerns over copyright infringement and intellectual property appropriation.

""The Shop"" was developed by James and ""Uninterrupted"" co-founder Maverick Carter. Its first episode, which premiered during the 2017 NBA Finals, generated approximately 4 million views across Uninterrupted.com and ESPN's YouTube channel, according to a copy of the letter obtained by ESPN.

""Your continued exploitation of 'Shop Talk' infringes 'Uninterrupted's' copyright, trademark rights and other valuable intellectual property rights in 'The Shop' and significantly damages 'Uninterrupted's' commercial prospects for 'The Shop,'"" the letter reads, in part.

The letter goes on to invite a conversation with Alabama before ""rushing into legal proceedings.""

1673,"Did the Mavs win? ❌ That was so fuckin close

3 losses! Giving it up for 3 losses in a row 🦀🔔

Was it competitive? ✔️ To be quite honest I didn't expect it to be this close

That was some good ass tanking at the end where we only pulled the plug on the offense in the 4th and only scored 10pts 🔌🏚️ 🔟

Good news is Chicago won today. As I type this, Atlanta looks like they'll win against Orlando, but hey either way we win off this game. EDIT: ATLANTA WON. Kinda wish Orlando won, they're more in our range, I don't think we can catch Atlanta more I think about it.✨🦅🐂

Did Barnes get his points? ✔️ He was on fire this game. Rick needed to pull him earlier 😏

Dirk had a efficient 9pt/6reb game if only he took more shots, then again we would've won if he did 😅🐐🇩🇪

DSJ ended with an average 14/4/5. He had a great first half but only had 5pts in the second. 😐

Not much else to say about this game really. I mean just look at that box score ☝️ 

Tonight was another factored in loss, but as shown tonight, nothing's guaranteed. Remember one loss or win can make a world of difference. So if possible we can only accept one more loss for the remaining games. We need that top pick cuz Draft Lottery is nearing closer ⤵️👇🎰🏓

Right now we are in a Musical Chairs situation with the bottom 10 teams so EVERY loss counts from here on out, it's the difference between the 1st and 10th pick 💺🎶🎵

We currently have the 5th worst record in the league. The bottom 10 are all within a measly 3 games of each other so we have to keep making em loss for loss and hope they steal a few games to end higher than us in the standings. This the final lap of the race with 5 games. 5️⃣🏁🏎️

Play hard, develop young talent, keep close, keep it competitive, but lose in the end to assure we get that ~~1st~~ 3rd Pick ☑️☑️☑️☑️☑️

We still have a bottom record guys. Remember the losses may feel bad now but the payoff is honestly worth it compared to what we've delt with for the past 6yrs. And if any of y'all who think we shouldn't tank still? WELL GUESS WHAT? WE'RE NO LONGER IN THE PLAYOFF PICTURE SO WINNING GAMES IS NOW NOTHING MORE THAN A PRIDE THING, ALL WE CAN DO NOW IS GET A HIGH DRAFT PICK. THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE MY BRETHREN! 🤔💭😬👈

I'll keep this last comment at the bottom in case any of you disagree with me on this. Idk why anybody would want us to stay on this mediocrity treadmill any longer than we have⤴️

We would go from a 65ish win team to a 45ish win team without Harden. The jump from a lottery team to a fringe playoff team is a lot easier to do than going from a fringe playoff team to the number 1 seed. 

And this argument is bullshit. You could say the same thing about any team with only one main playmaking star. 2015 Rockets, which Harden led to 55 wins and 2nd seed in the West, was worse than this Cavs iteration, and that played no argument in the MVP race. It never has historically either considering how literally EVERY MVP has gone to a team with the 1st to 3rd best record in the league, with the exception of WB because of his historical season. Every MVP has had help.

> LeBron is more efficient than Harden (62.2% to 61.7% TS) while shooting half the number of free throws.

There's a negligible difference in TS%, and yeah if LeBron took more 3s his percentage would drop too. Harden shoots more contested 3s than just about anyone in the league and he still averages the most iso ppg and per possession. 

> Harden struggles when CP3 is out, seeing sharp decreases in efficiency, effectiveness, and wins.

Yes, when you lose your only other playmaker, those things tend to happen. His stats are still MVP level without CP3, and we would still be in the mix for the playoffs in the West without him.

> Harden enjoys a stable, more rounded, and overall better team than LeBron.

Having a good team has never been a detriment in MVP voting. Like I said earlier, history favors the 1st to 3rd best records. CP3 has missed just as many games as Love. We've missed Ryno, LRMAM, and Capela for stretches at a time. Obviously the Cavs have restructured their entire team, but you can't hold that against Harden. It's not like the Cavs are filled with scrubs either. Either way, Harden never benefited from this in 2015, it was never an argument against Curry's MVPs, LeBron's Heatles MVPs, or literally any other MVP.

> LeBron has a clear edge in rebounding and defense, while holding a slight statistical edge in passing.

If you're going off of counting stats lmao. There's not a clear edge on defense. Harden's defense obviously isn't great, but it's average, and LeBron's defense hasn't been stellar either. The Cavs are one of the worst defensive teams. Defensive stats favor Harden, but their pretty sketchy, and from eye test they are both pretty average. Total assists aren't a good representation since LeBron is the primary ball handler while Harden has been sharing the floor with CP3. Even with that, their assists/game are nearly identical, though Harden has a higher Assist Percentage. You can't say he's a better ""passer"" off of that, it's disingenuous. I'm not going to argue total rebounds because if you think that matters when comparing a PG/SG to a point forward then idk. 

> LeBron is on pace to play all 82 games on a higher MPG, Harden is on pace for 72 games played.

Lol, this is just reaching. Harden's only missed 2 games in the last 3 seasons (81, 82, 81), and led in minutes for two of those seasons and no one gave a shit. This isn't a case of DPOY where some players have missed over a third of the season. This has never been in the conversation for MVP race, but gotta find points to give to Bron.

Fail to mention how Harden is beating Bron in just about every advanced stat (WS, WS/48, PER, BPM, OBPM, ORTG) except for VORP. And while people bitch about team record, it has always been a standard for MVP voting. Harden's led the Rockets to the number 1 seed in the harder West, while LeBron's Cavs are barely going to reach 50 wins in a weaker Eastern Conference.",45,MrTheNoodles,/r/nba/comments/88uohm/lebron_james_is_making_a_late_mvp_push_producing/dwnee0m/,dwnee0m,1522653740.0,1522624940.0,"LeBron James is making a late MVP push, producing absurdly efficient numbers over his last 25 games.

1739,"""Basketball fans like to scour the Web for highlights of stars we already know. The pleasure of rewatching their most acrobatic feats is like the satisfaction of rereading passages from a favorite book. But, to me—and, presumably, to the half a million people who routinely watch each of his videos—LeBron James, Jr., offers something different. It’s not only that his story is unfinished, or even just beginning, but that it seems to have two authors at once, each with a legacy to define. There’s the boy himself, thirteen and already in possession of immense talents, and there’s his father, perhaps the greatest basketball player of all time, who, at thirty-three, continues to play like he’s in his prime. Other sons of basketball stars have made the N.B.A., and a couple of them—Steph Curry, son of Dell; Kobe Bryant, son of Joe—have become superstars. But no one has so openly wrestled with his status as a hoops legend like LeBron James has. It was inevitable, when his son started playing, that the younger James would figure into the larger narrative. Watching him feels like the start of the next chapter.

Sports journalists and college scouts have been touting Jr. as his father’s son since before he reached middle school. Highlight reels circulated online with clips of a boy of average height, spindly but confident, heaving up a shot with two hands, or dunking on a mini-hoop in a suburban driveway. Glimpses like these were enough to prompt one newspaper headline to hail him, at twelve, as “a basketball clone of his dad.” Duke and Kentucky reportedly expressed interest in his future prospects. LeBron, Sr., sought to cool the hype at first, as any sensible father would. “Right now, all I care about is him having fun,” he said a few years ago. “He doesn’t need added pressure from his dad . . . . I’ll teach him when he gets old enough. I’ll wait till he gets thirteen, fourteen.” At that point, James said, he would share with his son what he called “the blueprint.”

Now that Jr. is old enough to access the master plan, the highlight videos are multiplying. The clips reveal a versatile guard, big for his age in both size and bearing, with an impressive handle and a smooth jumper. The echoes of his father’s game are hard to miss. LeBron, Jr., slashes to the basket, springing past defenders with crafty spins and beguiling hesitation moves. He shares the ball like his dad, with one-handed bounce passes whipped from great distances, crisp dishes, and creative finds in traffic. “He’s already a better passer than I was,” James has said.

If it’s odd to lavish so much attention on such a young kid, it’s also irresistible. When LeBron James was fourteen, he joined a local travel team and played at a tournament, in Orlando, that marked the start of his national ascension. “LeBron really separated himself,” his then-coach said, in the documentary “More Than a Game.” “You could see that he was the best player there.” By the time he was a junior in high school, he’d led his team to two state championships, and he appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated. His high-school outings were relocated to a nearby college gym to accommodate the crowds, and ESPN broadcasted the games with a full assembly of analysts—from Bill Walton to Dick Vitale—like they were college showdowns between top-tier teams. “He’s the best high-school basketball player I’ve ever seen,” Jay Bilas said, courtside, at one game. LeBron’s precocity aged him in some ways, both flattering and otherwise; he entered the league as a mature player, then, before our eyes, graduated to superstardom undiminished by the fact that everyone saw it coming.

Are we watching his son too expectantly? Maybe, but a highlight reel from the John Lucas All-Star Weekend, posted this month, suggests not. It’s easy to forget, while watching the player here, that he’s only thirteen. His command on the floor is expressed with an air of total nonchalance—enough to make his father seem like a late bloomer. The same goes for a February video, shot at his school, where he’s seen laying the ball in with grown-up English and tossing shovel passes from half-court. The competition isn’t as stiff as in the other videos, where he plays with his travel team, but he hardly seems to break a sweat.

If he were older, his future might have begun to take some discernible shape, or at least to assume a more tangible trajectory. Zaire Wade, whose father is the former LeBron teammate Dwyane Wade, is a sophomore in high school, and is looking like a serious player; Shareef O’Neal, son of Shaq, will play for U.C.L.A. next season. Their playing careers are becoming their own; reality will soon temper our expectations, or vindicate them. LeBron, Jr., is young enough for his future to look limitless. And with his father still dominating, after fifteen years in the pros, an absence of limits seems like part of the family inheritance.

My favorite question to ponder, as I watch Jr. carve up helpless young defenders, is whether his father is sharing with him some singular fount of basketball wisdom. The James genes are clearly the key part of the “blueprint,” but there’s a deeper code that father and son may have to unlock together. To become a great player is hard enough, but for a son to do it on his own terms, undimmed by the legacy of his dad, is something else again. Maybe that explains the travel-team jersey number of the younger James: zero, worn in honor of Russell Westbrook, one of his father’s rivals.""",47,julzthemadman691,/r/nba/comments/88ruh4/the_new_yorker_watching_the_story_of_lebron_james/dwmralk/,dwmralk,1522627845.0,1522599045.0,"[The New Yorker] Watching the Story of Lebron James, Jr., Unfold",184,88ruh4

The sample sizes for each individual matchup vs a player are small but the thing that stands out is look at who he tends to guard; it is usually a tertiary option for the opponent. 

People will say ""It's because htey want him to be a free safety on defense"" which is true and fine but LeBron has always had that role and used to spend far more time on opponents best players. And there are many good defenders in the NBA who are good off ball defender rover types who also spend more time guarding the opponents best player. 

Also in general as a result of LeBron not guarding the opponents best player it forces other teammates to defend tough matchups.

An example here. Look Jeff Green has played surprisingly well this year..........but it's not in the Cavs best interest to make him guard anybody from Kemba Walker to true 5's like DeAndre Jordan for long stretches of games(it's very rare for any individual player to be tasked with guarding 1-5 on this many poss like Green has).

1933,"gotta keep changing the goal posts my man

first it was that his team record wasn't good enough even though he led a shitty Rockets team to the 2nd seed in 2015. Harden had better counting stats but Curry had better advanced stats and Per 36. Harden was the scoring leader. Oh wait, same argument people are making for LeBron this year except Bron's team is gonna be a 3rd/4th seed with barely 50 wins. That 2015 team without Harden wouldve won 30 games max.

then it was WB putting up historical stats despite Harden leading the Rockets, with no other other stars, to 3rd seed and 3rd best record in 2017. But Bron isn't putting up record breaking numbers. 

now Harden has the better stats (similar box stats, better advanced stats), has the best record in the league, and now people are claiming his team is too good so he doesn't deserve it. CP3 has missed just as many games as Love. Capela was out for a stretch of games, Ryno's been injured, LRMAM has been injured, so it's not like the Cavs are the only team that has been hit with injury. And our record with Harden out is inflated considering 4 of the 5 games we won were against the worst teams in the league.
fuck that, where was that in 2015? where was that when Bron won MVP with Wade and Bosh? where was that with Curry's MVPs? or literally EVERY OTHER MVP IN THE HISTORY OF THE NBA. But nah let's keep these double standards. 

And lmao at people using games played or minutes played as a reason. Yall are reaching. This is the first year since 2014 that Harden hasn't played more than 81 games in a season, and he's led the league in minutes played in 15 and 16. That was never in the discussion for MVP, but let's add it now just because it is in Bron's favor. The rest argument has never been used against LeBron either in MVP debates. 

LeBron stans are reaching for non existent arguments and ignoring all semblance of historical trends. Look no one is saying that LeBron isn't the best player in the world, he is, but the MVP is given to the player who is having the best performing regular season, and suck it up, that player Harden.

2074,"Cedi Osman is widely referred to as the GOAT of the NBA even though he is just a rookie, which begs the question, who is he?

Let's start here...where was he on Christmas day when the Cavs took on the Warriors?

This year, the Cavs and Warriors faced off on Christmas with the Warriors beating the Cavs 99-92.  Lebron had a quiet-ish night with 20 points shooting 7-18 from the field and couldn't quite get the Cavs the W they were hoping for.  This begs the question...*where was the GOAT on this night?* Could he actually be Santa Claus?

Well, Cedi was 'at the game' that night and 'played' in 6 total minutes, putting up a line of 0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0 while shooting 0-2 from the field.

As we all know, this is not the Cedi we are used to seeing.  As David Ortiz once said, [""This is our fucking Cedi""](https://youtu.be/lqD8iN03W6M?t=41s).  Ortiz obviously was referring to when Cedi had been signed from the Cavs and he knew he was going to be the next GOAT.

Well, let's go deeper.  Cedi would never drop such a poor statline, so was this *actually* Cedi playing in this game? Sure he shows up on ESPN's box score, but who says that wasn't a stunt double to replace our GOAT?

Was anyone specifically looking for Cedi on the court this day? He shot 0% from the field, which is 52.1% lower than his actual shooting percentage.  This is just not our Cedi and David Ortiz might be onto something here.

I for one, have never seen Cedi and Santa Claus in the same room, and I don't think anyone has.  And yeah, if you think the stunt double option may be off, well maybe that is why Cedi only played 6 minutes...he had much bigger things to worry about that day than playing basketball.

Overall, I think we need to open an investigation and get to the bottom of this.  Cedi, the Cavs, the fans, and David Ortiz all deserve to know where our Cedi was on this day.

Jordan had 2 top tier defenders to help anchor his defense - Pippen had 8x 1st team def and 2x 2nd team def, Rodman (although he came a bit later) had 2 DPOY's. Couple that with being able to handcheck and it probably favoured athletic players on the wing.

My one gripe with LeBron is that the past few years he's been absolutely lazy on D for 90% of the regular season, but I can see why he's doing it - to save energy and go for the offensive accolades.

2980,"LeBron had a ton of defensive lapses last night. He's been lackadaisical on that end almost all season, tbh. For comparison's sake, James Harden has a dRPM of -0.35. Lebron is at -1.02. He basically never guards lead ball handler's anymore, taking more of a backline free safety role. That's fine in a nut shell, but he isn't calling out plays or rotations as that role dictates, and he also never seems to help off his guy or tag the roller. Maybe the effort and communication will change in the playoffs.


Given his consistent success, I think LeBron earns the benefit of the doubt. That said, when the undisputed leader of a team isn't doing his share on one end, it can be hard to get role players to do their share as well. Isaiah Thomas and Derrick Rose were never going to be plus defenders this year. In the past however, their teams have made it work on that end by covering for one another and playing selflessly. When LeBron is unwilling to do that, it sets indisputably sets and example. Opponents are scoring **8.6 fewer** points per 100 possessions when LeBron is off the court this year. It's the first year since he returned to Cleveland that the Cavs have played better defense with him sitting. Maybe they just don't have enough good defenders overall. Still, if something is going to change for the Cavs defensively, it's going to have to start with LeBron.",28,wildly-mediocre,/r/nba/comments/84w5yu/lebron_turns_into_a_statue_and_watches_as_nurkic/dvsynon/,dvsynon,1521247825.0,1521219025.0,Lebron turns into a statue and watches as Nurkic scores,2482,84w5yu
