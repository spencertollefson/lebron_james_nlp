150,"This is going to result in a possible fine, but definitely a wrist slap.

Gatorade is a Pepsi owned product that pays **huge** amounts of money to be the official sports drink of the Finals. That's why there are those cups and bottles at every press conference. That's why every team has the big orange coolers and Gatorade cups on the bench. 

Not so secret info, it's not always Gatorade in those cups, a lot of times it's water. But, Pepsi pays millions so they have to drink it out of a Gatorade cup. Now, Sprite, even as *official soft drink of the NBA*, does not pay for press conferences, or to be drank at any playoff or Finals game. 

Now you might say, but I've seen Powerade or Vitamin Water on the bench, and that's possible during the regular season, seen [here](http://news.yahoo.com/lightbox/boston-celtics-terry-green-pierce-sit-bench-during-photo-024809811.html), but come playoff time, Gatorade owns the court and pre/postgame stuff and they actually have Gatorade ""police"" that make sure their money is spent right. Awhile back, Raul Ibanez, baseball player, had someone make him pour his water from a water bottle into a Gatorade cup before talking to the press after a playoff game.

Sorry to run on here, but this kind of thing is super interesting to me.

Way too quick edit: This is why brands on jerseys is so insane to me, imagine if Lebron, a Coke sponsored athlete had to wear a Gatorade logo on his jersey. Or imagine a team like New York, sponsored by Powerade, but Powerade couldn't get a jersey logo because they aren't the official sports drink of the league.

This was back in 2006. I don't remember. I was in 3rd grade, So yes if you do the math I'm only 17, whatever.

I got the mavs jersey signed by Jason Terry & Josh Howard, but no other players. Mark Cuban was walking behind the bench talking to people, and me and my dad walked up to him. He signed the back of my jersey, and him and my dad were talking. He said something like if I was available when it was draft time he would pick me (I was a good basketball player, not great but whatever.) Well, when they were done, I personally talked to him. I was like hey, do you think you could get LeBron up here to sign my jersey? And he said something like I don't converse with the other team during games, and I said oh, and we went back to my seat. Well, after the third quarter, LeBron came over to the mavs bench, saw my friend wearing his jersey, and said ""hey come here, lemme sign that."" So me and my friend walked up to the bench and my friend held out the jersey from his chest while lebron used my sharpie to sign my jersey. I said thanks, and he said ""No problem, kid.""

168,"when Jordan was winning his rings I was like 10-14. I loved basketball back then, although I was a Utah fan. As spanish I was in Spain. Miles away from USA, no Internet, just tv news.

Jordan was a sensation, a hero. Everybody knew and loved him. I remember when we got the NBA trading cards everybody was baffled because he was ""short"". During the NBA finals there were always rumors the next day about something magic Jordan did. Like the flu game, or one game that the bulls beat Utah by 40. I remember when Jordan came back after his retirement, his 55 game was everywhere.

Jordan was a world sensation. Like Maradona, like Federer, like Senna, like Phelps. He got it. Lebron doesnt have it. Lebron is one of the best players ever, but outside sports community, nobody gives a shit. On the other hand, Jordan is the type of guy who converted random people to NBA fans.

To be honest I would put Bird and Magic in a similar position to Jordan. They were world sensations. I wasnt born back then, but I love NBA, and when I speak with ""older"" people about NBA, here in Spain, they all come back to Magic and Bird. Sort to say, in Spain anybody in their 30s early 40s loved Magic and Bird. I dont feel the same wave for Lebron.

Also, and probably you all will disagree, Id say the marketing now of NBA is worse than before.",35,the_phet,/r/nba/comments/1gdrwk/did_people_hate_mj_as_much_as_lebron/cajca57/,cajca57,1371317361.0,1371288561.0,Did people hate MJ as much as Lebron?,38,1gdrwk

170,"Definitively not. He was such a sensation that the overwhelming opinion was positive. 

You must understand that when he came into the league in 84-85, Magic and Bird were the two most heralded players by a wide margin over all players. Both had immediately re-established a long standing rivalry between the Lakers and Celtics. and won 2 titles each by the time MJ came on the scene.

He was a breath of fresh air as a young, dynamic alternative to Bird/Magic and didn't yet have the successful teams and talented teammates to really challenge or put fear in other fans minds which was a natural deterrent to the type of 'hating' we see today.

I've seen the social media arguments made and I think it's a moot point. It wasn't the dark ages. We did have 24 hr cable news and yes, even ESPN so there was plenty of access to NBA info. Additionally we saw the first megastar athlete endorser at previously unknown levels with the Chevy, McDonalds, Coke, and of course Air Jordan commercials, just to name a few.

So the fact that his teams weren't at the elite, championship caliber levels until the late '80's meant that a lot of the kind of Lebron type resentment you see today just couldn't bear fruit.

The other aspect when compared to Lebron was that you hadn't heard of Jordan during his HS days. He was even kind of under the radar as a Tarheel albeit aficionados recognized his talent even as some aspects of his game were suppressed by Dean Smith's system and on-court philosophy.  

So the attitude or personna bestowed upon him during his 1st 4-5 years was of an overachieving (team) led by a super-hungry, ultra competitive and hard working player who gave max effort all game long on both sides of the court, and wowed the crowd nightly with previously unseen displays of basketball artistry. This consideration when juxtaposed against the established stars and teams, (Magic/Bird, Lakers/Celts) made him pretty much universally admired.",50,SaMoSetter,/r/nba/comments/1gdrwk/did_people_hate_mj_as_much_as_lebron/caj9lmp/,caj9lmp,1371301791.0,1371272991.0,Did people hate MJ as much as Lebron?,38,1gdrwk

Also, I don't think people talk about Finals MVPs enough. Basically means you were the best player on the best team.

Kobe 5 titles, 2 finals mvps, 15 all star games, 1 MVP, 11 all nba 1st team, 2 all nba 2nd team, 2 all nba 3rd team, 9 all defensive 1st team, 3 all defensive 2nd team

From that they are extremely comparable, I think that about evens out. Then can look at team records. 

(not factoring in injuries) 

Spurs since 1997 went: 

56 - 26 for 2nd in division and lost in the 2nd round

37 - 13 won the division and won nba championship

53 - 29 2nd in division and lost first round

58 - 24 won division and lost conference finals

58 - 24 won division and lost 2nd round

60 - 22 won division and won nba finals

57 - 25 2nd in division and lost 2nd round

59 - 23 1st in division and won nba finals

63 - 19 1st in division and lost 2nd round

58 - 24 2nd in division and won nba finals

56 - 26 2nd in division and lost conference finals

54 - 28 1st in division and lost first round

50 - 32 2nd in division and lost 2nd round

61 - 21 first in division and lost in 1st round

50 - 16 first in division and lost in conference finals

58 - 24 first in division and TBA.

That is a grand total of 10 division titles, never going below 2nd in division. 

Kobe since joining the lakers

56 - 26 2nd in division lost 2nd round

61 - 21 2nd in division lost confrence finals

31- 19 2nd in division lost 2nd round

67 - 15 1st in division won nba finals

56 - 26 1st in division won nba finals

58 - 24 2nd in division won nba finals

50 - 32 2nd in division lost 2nd round

56 - 26 1st in division lost nba finals

34 - 48 4th in division did not make playoffs

45 - 37 3rd in division lost first round

42 - 40 2nd in division lost first round

57 - 25 1st in division lost in finals

65 - 17 1st in division won nba finals

57 - 25 1st in division won nba finals

57 - 25 	1st in division lost 2nd round

41 - 25 1st in division lost 2nd round

45 - 37 3rd in division lost 1st round. 

That is 8 division championships, lowest finish is 4th and 3rd.

So while Kobe has won 1 more title and went to 2 more finals than Duncan (counting this year for a finals appearance and possible tying them in titles). However, the Spurs have been in the conference finals more times (3 to the Lakers 1 without going to finals). Both exited the first round 3 times. Duncan's Spurs however have dominated the regular season and their division for a much longer time. Their legacies are very close but considering just how consistent at domination of the nba the spurs have been I would give Tim Duncan an edge in being dominate.

Thank you Hibbert. Everyone flops in this league there is no reason why it should only be synonymous with the Heat. I do agree that Wade at times does some of the most egregious flops, but what I can't stand is when people cry flop on pretty much every charge the Heat defense gets. The rules are the rules and the Heat (specifically Battier) are great at drawing charges.

I don't like the mindset Wade and Lebron have about flopping, but who can blame them? It's been going on for a long time and due to slim consequences, is seen as a way to get an advantage over opponents. If the league wants to seriously get rid of flopping once and for-all they have to start reviewing tape and suspending players for blatant ones.

When he was in high school him and his buddies, who played at Akron powerhouse Central Hower HS (two of them were all summit county players), were playing a pickup game at a park close to downtown. He said an 11 year old came over and asked to play and he had to convince his friends to let the kid play with them. He told me he never saw somebody look so comfortable and his friends went from horsing around to playing serious ball. His friends lost two games and refused to play again, probably from the fear of getting worked even more by somebody 7 years younger. Of course this 11 year old was named LeBron. He said he thinks he would have forgotten all about it if it weren't for the originality of the kid's name. 6 years later he's on the cover of sports illustrated.

I got to go to multiple St. Vincent-St. Mary basketball camps and watched LeBron play throughout his high school career. I cannot put into words what his presence on the court was like. He was simply a man amongst boys.

517,"A reporter takes a quote out of context, asks a player about it, the player responds in a somewhat annoyed manner with no indication that he actually heard the full quote.  The [full quote](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=3GBg-qw6MFg#t=277s) was, as many have said, innocuous.  If anything he was saying they are just excited about being in the position and do not view it as a grudge match over last year, but rather an opportunity to win the title.  About as innocuous as they come, and the phrase ""just another team"" was not a slight against Miami, but rather dismissive of the bad blood/extra motivation that was implied by the reporter's question.  

Now a reporter asks Lebron about it and does he say ""In response to a question about getting another shot at Miami Vogel said that it was not about getting back at Miami, but rather trying to win a title, and that Miami was just another team in their way.""  Nope the reporter said “Vogel kept saying last night that you guys are just another team.’’  This is annoying in part because Vogel did not keep saying it, he said it once, and he said it in response to question, it was a small part of the response.

Player B Career numbers: 

45.6% FG%/ 33.4 3P% /6.4 Rebounds per game /3.1 assists per game /1.1 steals per game/ .5 blocks per game / 25.0 ppg


A is Kobe, B is Melo. Their career numbers are similar. Obviously Melo is not as good as Kobe, particularly on defense.

To put it simply, Melo needs help. The Knicks have guys that can score, but they just dont have another all-star type contributor. Everyone needs help. All the greats had other great players to help win titles. 

Melo's career isn't over. He will eventually be on a team with someone that is close or better than him. He will get a good look at a title in the future. Just probably not any time soon.

But how we see them: consensus all-star, HoF talent, and always in the top 10 of MVP voting with some years being more in the running and others not (based on the narrative of the year.)

People always looked for reasons why Dirk's teams couldn't win the title: ""he's good, BUT he's soft."" or, ""he's good, BUT he can't win the big one.""

Melo's in that territory right now. 

Obviously, Dirk made the Finals in 2006 and won a title a few years ago. I think Melo can win a title, too. And I think he can be that number one guy. But I think he has the type of game where you need better roleplayers to achieve at a higher level to win, as opposed to someone like LeBron or Kobe.

It reminds me of another Simmons article, speculating about the quite-possible scenario of LeBron winning another couple of titles on Miami, then upping sticks to somewhere else and becoming the NBAs first mobile one-man Dynasty. Thee thought being that the '90s belonged to Jordan's Bulls, the '00s to Duncan's Spurs/Shaq&Kobe's Lakers, and the '10s could easily belong to LeBron's LeBrons. 

People forget just how bad LeBron (often) had it on the Cavs, with crap temmates and a braindead coach, and he still came close there. And that was just demi-god LeBron. Godmode Lebron would probably drag 10 or so of the teams on this list to a title. Especially since with no James on The Heat and no Westbrook on The Thunder, there'd be no outstanding competition.

707,"Well, what players would work least well with LeBron.  You probably want a team that has no three point shooters, best player already plays Lebron's position, and already has solid D and ball movement.  

I am going to say a healthy Chicago.  Already great team D that Lebron obviously helps, but not as significantly as other teams.

Both pretty awful 3 point team that will clog the paint too much for Lebron.  

Derrick Rose is such a high usage guy who needs the ball.  You start getting Westbrook, Durant sharing issues.  Derrick Rose's average 3-point shooting and no good shooting guard really clogs the paint.

The team is already super coached and smart that adding Lebron's veteran presence won't offer much of a lift.

Last, Chicago is deep and deep in the positions Lebron plays.  Lebron would take minutes from Dung, Butler, or if they go small from Boozer or Noah.  Clearly Lebron better, but those players fit very well with what Chicago wants to do and probably better replacements than most other teams.  

Overall, Adding Lebron automatically improves your team.  Think the impact is smallest for the Bulls.  I would argue Boston a close 2nd for same reasons.

If benefit means:

More regular season games won - He would least benefit OKC because they have 60 wins without him. 

More ticket sales - He would least benefit the Bulls. They already sellout every game. 

Higher chance to win a title - This is where it gets hard. The Bobcats had the worst odds going into the season @ 500:1. OKC was about 4:1. With Lebron, the odds the Bobcats win the title goes way up, but with OKC it only goes up a little, but they would be the huge favorite.. I'd say if he went to the Bobcats there still isn't enough talent to win a title, so even though he would increase their odds the most perhaps, if he didn't win the title it would be a 0 benefit from the perspective of title.

""We could also mention that we've never witnessed 26.9 points, 8.1 rebounds and 7.2 assists on 56.2 percent shooting in NBA history. Not Jordan. Not Oscar. Not Bird. Not Magic.
But it's the 56.2 percent shooting that stands out. Let's try to wrap our heads around that. In order to catch James in field goal percentage, Durant -- he of an amazing 50.6 shooting percentage of his own -- would have to make his next 176 shots without missing once. And that's just to catch James. What about Kobe? Making 300 straight wouldn't even do it for Kobe; he'd need 49 more.
And Carmelo? He could make his next 350 shots and he'd still trail James in field goal percentage. That's the equivalent of Carmelo shooting a perfect 14-for-14 for 25 straight games, and James would still look down on him in the field goal percentage column.
Let that marinate for a second.""",150,noobeater,/r/nba/comments/1c0di0/carmelo_could_make_350_straight_shots_and_still/c9btfft/,c9btfft,1365568156.0,1365539356.0,Carmelo could make 350 straight shots and still trail LeBron in FG%,102,1c0di0

990,"I was raised on a firm hatred of Michael Jordan by my father, who grew up listening to the Russel-era Celtics and has had an undying love of the game. 

He did not hate good players. In fact he loved them; still raves about Magic and Kareem despite being a die-hard Celtics fan. Today, he loves LeBron and says he's glad to be alive and able to watch such a rare talent.

What he hated about Jordan was his arrogance. The fact that he said Scottie Pippen was ""like a little brother"" is one he brings up a lot. Scottie was a top 50 player all-time, and he's your teammate. You don't say shit like that about your teammate, you give them credit for helping *you* achieve greatness. That is, if you're a decent human being.

He *did* hate LeBron after ""the decision."" After LeBron spent 2011 eating humble pie though, he's like a new player. He never seems to talk shit, he never specifically alludes to his own greatness in an interview, he just goes out every night and plays staggeringly good basketball. Moreover, he refuses to live in Jordan's shadow. He's going out there and - unlike Kobe who's doing a great lifelong Jordan impression - forging his own path with a blend of skills that the game has never seen before.

He gets other players involved, he keeps humble in interviews (now), he plays amazing basketball, and he pays homage to the greats who came before him. 

So no, he did not hate Michael Jordan as much as LBJ. He hated him a lot more. My own philosophy is about the same, but I have more respect for Jordan's game than my dad does.",89,RIPEOTCDXVI,/r/nba/comments/1aljj9/nba_fans_outside_of_chicago_did_you_hate_michael/c8yim68/,c8yim68,1363739078.0,1363710278.0,"NBA fans outside of Chicago, did you hate Michael Jordan as much as people hate Lebron James today?",61,1aljj9
