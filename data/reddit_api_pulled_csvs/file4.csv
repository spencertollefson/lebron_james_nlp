""I don't pick and choose what LeBron should talk about any more than any talking head should try to pick and choose what he talks about. To me, when I heard about that, it was like an unbelievable show of arrogance for a talking head to try to tell someone else if they can speak, what they can speak about, when and where to do it. It's just ludicrous. But to not have a feel for who this guy is…think about when he came into the public view. How young was he? And to this day he hasn't missed a step. He hasn't fallen off the ledge. He's been a brilliant example for millions of kids, especially of kids of lesser opportunity who haven't had the same advantages of others. And they see in this guy somebody who's consistently exhibited excellence in the workplace. It gives them a voice, let's them know that you can speak about anything. There really is a first amendment, and I can have opinions as a coach, as a plumber, as an astrophysicist, as a lowly reporter. I can have whatever opinions I want. And that's what's amazing about this. When you look at this guy, how many tens of millions of dollars he's given? Tens of millions of kids that see him, that are inspired by him. It's kind of like the Black Panther movie. How cool is that for kids to see that and have that superhero? Well, now, LeBron has been that for a long time. And for somebody to be totally numb to that and attack him in such a childish way, really speaks more volumes about that individual than it does Lebron. He's very, very special. We should all be very proud that we have somebody like that who's willing to speak about a variety of topics, and you've listened to them all.""

> The story is of LeBron James' failure. He was as bad as I could imagine he'd ever be. He was atrocious. Atrocious.

> Earlier in the playoffs we talked about how he was, I thought then, being brilliant in conserving energy early in games to be fresh for crunch time. Now I realize he was just being lazy.

> He competed pretty hard on defense throughout the playoffs, but not tonight. He was a dog on offense. He was not a dog on defense, except for late in the series when he got tired of chasing Jason Terry.

> I have serious concerns. You can't be him, with his abilities, and have one less offensive rebound than J.J. Barea. I'm not one to use stats like that to crush a guy, but I spent this game repeatedly rewinding my DVR and watching in slow motion. I studied him. I mostly saw him standing and watching. I saw balls fall near him as he did nothing.

> That's a severe gut check. That's a severe sign of a heart problem.

> We came into these playoffs with all kinds of questions about Bosh's heart. I would not question his heart now. He was wrecked by this loss. I definitely question, however, where LeBron's head is. He didn't play like he cared. If I were his teammate, I'd have a serious problem with that.

> I only talk like this as someone who spent the night rewinding the DVR and seeing LeBron stand six feet away from the play, watching. Doing nothing.

> As a thinking person, he'd have to be blown away at how average he was. Yes he had a triple-double in Game 5, but he could put up those numbers in his sleep.

> If I were Pat Riley, I'd bring in a psychologist. And I'd say hey, man, you screwed up. But it's over.

711,"Some dude got absolutely shit on one of the threads yesterday for pointing out that Ingraham took aim at LeBron and Durant (over Trump's many white detractors) specifically because they're black.  Like no fucking shit.  ""Shut up and dribble"" has such a fucking terrible connotation and it's absolutely drenched in racism.  ""Your job is to dribble and not speak"" is the sort of attitude that has been driven to the forefront with Trump, it's not even *thinly veiled* racism, it's just straight up racism. 

How people can justify it is beyond me.  

EDIT: I will clarify for the good-faith inquirers.  Racist social policies in America were designed in an effort to maintain white superiority over African Americans.  Everything from [Redlining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining) to the [war on drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_the_War_on_Drugs) were thinly veiled attempts to maintain the status quo, to undo the progress put forth by the 13th amendment.  

So while Ingraham (however the fuck you spell her name) seems like she would levy a similar accusation against white celebrities, the subtext (and frankly, the way she phrased her statement) *seems* to come from a position of outight indignation.  The attack on their levels of education, the way she worded ""shut up and dribble"" (as if it was an order) points to the notion that she feels the place of a black man in America is to entertain only, and never to provide insight or social commentary.

It sounds fucking crazy to say, but the way these pundits (the fox ones) treat black athletes (including Kaepernic) is almost like ""your job is to play"" the same way they would tell slaves ""your job is to pick cotton"".

Correct me if I'm wrong, but this is exactly as how I interpret it.  Of course I could be wrong.  Of course LBJ and KD could also be wrong, but when you look at the history of race relations in America the picture becomes a lot more clear over time.

And if I'm wrong, convince me why.",195,Wilfs,/r/nba/comments/7y9bls/lebron_james_addresses_recent_controversy_during/dueli65/,dueli65,1518931016.0,1518902216.0,LeBron James addresses recent controversy during All-Star Media Availability,806,7y9bls

You don't have to agree with what LeBron said about Trump, which I personally argue with what he said. Really though, you made it quite clear you didn't. In the process of not agreeing, you trashed the man. 

- You sat there and called him a ""dumb jock,"" who left high school early to join the NBA. Also pointing out, that LeBron James is a ""lesson"" as to why kids shouldn't drop out of high school. All of this is wrong btw, LeBron graduated high school and has a HS diploma. 

- In an attempt to make LeBron a garbage person, you just showed the clip where LeBron said 'fuck' and failed to show anything after that and label it as 'R-rated politics'. This is where you calling him dumb and inadequate to talk about any politics comes in. 

- As to respond to LeBron's response on this, you show the 2016 NBA Parade when LeBron and Cleveland won the Finals. You just kept showing where LeBron said 'fuck', like we didn't get it in the first place. You are really trying to make LeBron seem like an awful person, when in reality you're the awful person. This also came off a little racist. 

But damn, LeBron James is so right and you are so wrong here. On top of that, back to that pro-Constitution talk, LeBron can say whatever the **FUCK** he wants to say. Wanna know why the main reason you were after LeBron here? It's because he doesn't like Trump. Where were you guys when Curt Schillings was talking?

LeBron James is really one of the most kindest and charitable people. He donates millions of his own money, he builds schools in the urban Akron area, he is really good with kids, he is a phenomenonal family man. On top of all that, he is one of the top 3-5 greatest basketball players ever. What are you, the 106th best FOX anchors? I really hope your show loses viewers and FOX pulls the plug on you.

842,"Man, LeBron is legit everything a conservative would want from a young black man.

Grew up poor, fatherless, and with very little.  Embraced the mentorship he received. Kept his head down and worked hard. Made the most of his talents.  Once he made his millions, he turned around and did an insane amount of charity work, primarily aimed at helping kids get their education, pay for poor kids who stay clean to go to college.  He married his high school sweetheart and started a family of his own.  He's been essentially scandal-free in a social media era where EVERYTHING eventually comes out.

Now in the later part of his basketball career, he's focusing on business interests in addition to his athletic career.  He invested in businesses that employ people in entertainment, marketing, food service, etc.  He shined a light on entrepreneurs in Cleveland who are up and coming.

And to people like Laura Ingraham, he's still just an uppity negro who doesn't know his place.

952,"posted this recently in it's own thread but, Bron will easily break the all-time scoring record. it will take him 4 more seasons:

1) If Bron goes off, he passes Dirk later this year. 739 pts to go. Bron would need to average about 28 ppg for the remaining 27 games of the season. But Dirk is still playing, and still scoring. If Bron plays in 24 of the 27 remaining games in the 2018 regular season, and averages 25ppg, he'll end up with 600 more points and have 30,812 by the end of the 2017-18 season. Dirk will end up with about 31,200. So let's say he passes Dirk in the first month or two of next season.

2) That brings us to 2018-19. Bron passes Wilt ""The Stilt"" Chamberlain sometime around the holiday season of 2018, shortly after passing Dirk. He also will only need 1,480 points to pass MJ. Considering LeBron has 1449 points already at this point in this season, it's conceivable he could enter the 2019 All-Star Game as the #4 all time leading scorer, ahead of MJ. If he averages 25.3 ppg and plays in 76 games, he should end up the 2019 season with 32,712 points.

3) In 2019-20, when LeBron will be entering his 17th season, he will need only 931 points to pass Kobe. Assuming he puts up 23 ppg in 2019-20, and plays 70 games (1610 points), he will end the year with 34,322 points, and pass Kobe before the All-Star Game.

4) He enters 2020-21 as the number 3 All-Time leading scorer, 2,606 points behind Karl Malone. Say he puts up 3,000 points in the next two years, passes Malone late in 2021-22, and ends that season with 37,332 points.

5) LeBron would then enter the 2022-23 season five years from now at 37 years old, entering his 20th season. He will need 1,055 points to pass Kareem, so he has the potential to do it around the All-Star Game. Regardless, he should enter the 2023 Finals, his 13th straight NBA Finals Appearance, as the #1 all-time leading scorer in NBA History, ending that season with 1400 points and 38,732 total.

6) Let's say Bron retires at age 41. And in his last 3 seasons (2023-24, 24-25 and 25-26), he averages 65 games and 20 ppg (3900~4000 total points). If he plays 8 more seasons, then in this hypothetical career timeline using projected averages, LeBron James will end up with 42, 732 points and 23 seasons played.",36,bronxdon,/r/nba/comments/7xmpvz/lebron_is_39_assists_away_from_3000080008000_for/du9x4s2/,du9x4s2,1518703937.0,1518675137.0,LeBron is 39 assists away from 30000/8000/8000 for his career,1866,7xmpvz
